## 🎭 What is a Companion?

A **companion** is your AI's trading personality and focus. When you choose a companion, you're telling the AI:

* What kind of trader you are
* What timeframes you care about
* What type of analysis you need
* How aggressive or conservative you want to be

**Your companion changes:**

* How the AI talks to you
* What prompts it suggests
* What trade setups it shows you
* The analysis style it uses

## 🎯 How Companions Change Your Experience

### Example Question: _"Is Tesla a good buy?"_

**Money Monty Response:**

> "TSLA looks solid from both angles. Technical A+, fundamental B+. Entry $465-470. Target $490 in 10 days. Volume strong. Consider 2-3% position size. Risk/reward: 2.5:1."

**Sage Response:**

> "TSLA Fundamental Grade: B-. Company is growing fast (50%+ revenue growth) but valuation is stretched. P/E of 75 vs industry avg of 15. Long-term story is strong (EV leader, AI potential) but current price reflects a lot of optimism. For long-term buy & hold: Wait for pullback to $400-420 for better entry or DCA gradually."

**Maverick Response:**

> "TSLA momentum is 🔥! Technical A+, crushing relative strength. Breaking out with MASSIVE volume. Catalyst: AI hype. Entry $465-470 NOW. Target $495 in 2 weeks. Ride this wave! Stop $455. 🚀"

**Blitz Response:**

> "TSLA Technical Grade: A+. Strong momentum, currently at $465. Key resistance at $470 (break = target $478). Support at $460 (break = bail). High volume confirms move. Consider $470 calls exp this week. Risk/reward: 3:1. In and out by 2pm."
