## 🆚 Maverick vs Regular Chat

### Regular AI Chat 💬
- Generic trading advice
- Doesn't know what you own
- General market analysis
- Good for research

**Example:**
> **You:** "Should I buy TSLA?"
> **AI:** "TSLA looks strong technically. Entry around $465 could work."

---

### Ask Maverick 📊
- Knows your exact holdings
- Sees your cost basis
- Understands your risk exposure
- Personalized to YOUR situation

**Example:**
> **You:** "Should I buy TSLA?"
> **Maverick:** "You already own 10 shares of TSLA at $450 cost basis, currently up 3.3%. Your TSLA position is 15% of your portfolio. Adding more would increase concentration risk. Consider trimming other positions or looking at different sectors instead."

**Personalized = Better advice**

> **YTD Return:** +18.5%
>

---

### Example 2: Position Decision

**You:** "Should I sell my TSLA at a loss?"

**Maverick:**
> **Your TSLA Position:**
> - Cost Basis: $465/share
> - Current Price: $438
> - Loss: -$270 (-5.8%)
> - Held for: 15 days
>
> **Analysis:**
> - TSLA Snapshot Grade: B (was A+ at purchase)
> - Recent news: Delivery numbers missed estimates
> - Technical: Broke support at $450, next support $420
> - Sentiment: Turned bearish on WSB and Twitter
>
> **Recommendation: SELL** 🔴
>
> **Why:**
> 1. Broken technical setup (lost $450 support)
> 2. Fundamental catalyst negative (missed deliveries)
> 3. Sentiment shifted
> 4. Could retest $420 (-$18 more downside)
>
> **Action:** Sell now, take the 5.8% loss, look for re-entry at $420-430 if interested. Sometimes the best trade is exiting a bad trade early.
>
> **Tax note:** This is a short-term loss, can offset gains.

>
> **3 Recommendations:**
>
> **1. JNJ (Johnson & Johnson)** - Healthcare
> - Grade: A
> - Why: Defensive, dividend aristocrat, would add stability
> - Position size: 5-10% of portfolio
> - Entry: $158-162
>
> **2. XLE (Energy ETF)** - Energy Sector
> - Grade: B+
> - Why: You have zero energy exposure, sector rotating in
> - Position size: 5% of portfolio
> - Entry: Current levels
>
> **3. MSFT (Microsoft)** - Tech (but defensive)
> - Grade: A+
> - Why: You own no mega-cap tech with moat, quality company
> - Position size: 10-15% of portfolio
> - Entry: Dips to $370-375
>
> **Don't buy all at once.** Add one per week to dollar-cost average.
