## 💡 Managing Positions

### 1. Setting Exit Targets

**For each position, track:**

**Profit Target 🎯**

* Where you'll sell for gains
* Example: Bought TSLA at $450, target $500 (+11%)

**Stop Loss 🛑**

* Where you'll bail if wrong
* Example: Bought at $450, stop at $430 (-4.4%)

**How to set in Ape AI:**

1. Tap/click position
2. Go to ticker page
3. Set price alerts at your targets
4. Get notified when hit

***

### 2. Risk Management

**Position Size Check**

* Don't let any single stock be >20% of portfolio
* Ape AI shows % of portfolio for each holding
* AI alerts if you're too concentrated

**Example:**

> ⚠️ **Warning:** TSLA is now 35% of your portfolio. Consider trimming to reduce risk.

***

### 3. Reviewing Underperformers

**Weekly task:**

1. Sort by % Loss
2. Review bottom 3 positions
3. Ask yourself:
   * Is my thesis still valid?
   * Has anything changed?
   * Should I cut losses?

**Portfolio AI:** "Should I hold or sell \[TICKER]?"

***

### 4. Profit Taking

**When a position is up big:**

1. Sort by % Gain
2. See top performers
3. Consider taking partial profits
4. "Nobody went broke taking profits"

**Example:**

* NVDA up 50% since purchase
* Sell half, lock in gains
* Let the rest ride

**Ask AI:** "NVDA is up 50%. Should I take profits?"
