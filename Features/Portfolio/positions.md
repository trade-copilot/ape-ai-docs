## 💡 Managing Positions

### 1. Setting Exit Targets

**For each position, track:**

**Profit Target 🎯**
- Where you'll sell for gains
- Example: Bought TSLA at $450, target $500 (+11%)

**Stop Loss 🛑**
- Where you'll bail if wrong
- Example: Bought at $450, stop at $430 (-4.4%)

**How to set in Ape AI:**
1. Tap/click position
2. Go to ticker page
3. Set price alerts at your targets
4. Get notified when hit

---

### 2. Risk Management

**Position Size Check**
- Don't let any single stock be >20% of portfolio
- Ape AI shows % of portfolio for each holding
- AI alerts if you're too concentrated

**Example:**
> ⚠️ **Warning:** TSLA is now 35% of your portfolio. Consider trimming to reduce risk.

---

### 3. Reviewing Underperformers

**Weekly task:**
1. Sort by % Loss
2. Review bottom 3 positions
3. Ask yourself:
   - Is my thesis still valid?
   - Has anything changed?
   - Should I cut losses?

**Ask Maverick:** "Should I hold or sell [TICKER]?"

---

### 4. Profit Taking

**When a position is up big:**
1. Sort by % Gain
2. See top performers
3. Consider taking partial profits
4. "Nobody went broke taking profits"

**Example:**
- NVDA up 50% since purchase
- Sell half, lock in gains
- Let the rest ride

**Ask AI:** "NVDA is up 50%. Should I take profits?"
