## 💡 Writing Good Theme Descriptions

### The Formula

**Basic Structure:**
```
[What kind of stocks] + [Price range] + [Key criteria]
```

**Examples:**
- "Large cap tech stocks with P/E under 25"
- "Dividend stocks yielding over 4% with 10+ year history"
- "Small cap biotech companies with upcoming FDA catalysts"

---

### Be Specific vs Vague

#### ❌ Too Vague

**Bad:** "Good stocks"
- **Problem:** AI doesn't know what "good" means to you
- **Result:** Random stocks

**Bad:** "Stocks to buy"
- **Problem:** No criteria at all
- **Result:** Won't work

**Bad:** "Cheap stocks"
- **Problem:** Cheap by price? By valuation? By market cap?
- **Result:** Inconsistent results

---

#### ✅ Specific & Clear

**Good:** "Tech stocks under $50 with positive earnings and revenue growth over 20%"
- **Why:** Clear criteria (sector, price, earnings, growth)
- **Result:** Exactly what you want

**Good:** "Dividend aristocrats in the consumer goods sector yielding over 3%"
- **Why:** Specific type (aristocrats), sector, yield threshold
- **Result:** Focused list

**Good:** "Stocks breaking 52-week highs with volume over 5M shares"
- **Why:** Technical criteria clearly defined
- **Result:** Actionable list

---

## 🔧 Refining Your Theme

### Not Happy with Results?

**Problem: Too many stocks (100+)**

**Solution:** Add more filters
- Narrow price range
- Add fundamental criteria
- Specify sector
- Add minimum market cap

**Example:**
- Before: "Growth stocks"
- After: "Growth stocks in tech sector, market cap over $10B, P/E under 30, priced $100-$500"

---

**Problem: Too few stocks (0-3)**

**Solution:** Relax some criteria
- Widen price range
- Remove one filter
- Broaden sector
- Lower thresholds

**Example:**
- Before: "Stocks under $10 with 50%+ revenue growth and P/E under 10"
- After: "Stocks under $20 with 30%+ revenue growth" (removed P/E filter)

---

**Problem: Wrong stocks appearing**

**Solution:** Be more specific
- Use exact terminology
- Exclude what you don't want
- Add clarifying criteria

**Example:**
- Before: "Banking stocks" (getting regional banks)
- After: "Large cap banking stocks (market cap over $50B) excluding regional banks"

## 📊 Test Your Theme

### After Creating, Check:

**1. Stock Count**
- Sweet spot: 10-30 stocks
- Too many? Add filters
- Too few? Relax criteria

**2. Relevance**
- Are these actually what you wanted?
- Any outliers that don't fit?
- Refine description if needed

**3. Diversity**
- All from one sector? Maybe too narrow
- All moving together? Consider if that's good or bad
- Mix of winners and losers? Probably well-balanced

**4. Liquidity**
- Can you actually trade these?
- Check volume (especially for day traders)
- Illiquid stocks? Add volume requirement

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Start Broad, Then Narrow

**Process:**
1. Create general theme first
2. See what you get
3. Add filters to narrow down
4. Repeat until perfect

**Example:**
1. "Tech stocks" → 500 results
2. "Tech stocks under $200" → 150 results
3. "Tech stocks under $200 with positive earnings" → 40 results
4. "Tech stocks under $200 with positive earnings and P/E under 30" → 15 results ✅

---

### 2. Use Themes to Answer Questions

**Instead of asking AI every day, create a theme:**

**Question:** "What are good dividend stocks?"
**Better:** Create theme "Quality Dividend Stocks" and monitor daily

**Question:** "Any tech stocks breaking out?"
**Better:** Create "Tech Breakouts" theme, check it every morning

**Themes = Persistent answers to recurring questions**

---

### 3. Seasonal Themes

**Create themes for different times of year:**

**Q4 (Nov-Dec):** "Retail stocks with strong holiday sales"
**Q1 (Jan-Mar):** "Beaten-down quality stocks (tax-loss selling rebound)"
**May:** "Sell in May candidates (weak seasonality stocks)"
**September:** "September effect bargains"

**Archive themes when season ends, reactivate next year**

---

### 4. Layer Themes for Better Picks

**Method:**
1. Create Theme A: "Undervalued Stocks"
2. Create Theme B: "Momentum Stocks"
3. Ask AI: "Which stocks appear in both my Undervalued AND Momentum themes?"
4. Result: Value stocks starting to move = sweet spot

**Best opportunities = intersection of multiple themes**

---

### 5. Copy & Modify

**See a suggested theme you like?**
1. Add it
2. Edit it
3. Modify to your preference
4. Save as new custom version

**No need to start from scratch!**

---

## 🚀 Advanced Tips

### Use Exclusions

**Include this in your description:**

**Example:**
> "Tech stocks under $100, excluding semiconductors and hardware"

**Why:** Remove subsectors you don't want

---

### Combine Multiple Strategies

**Example:**
> "Dividend stocks yielding over 3% that are also undervalued (P/E under 15) and have positive momentum (up in past month)"

**Result:** Dividend + Value + Momentum all in one

---

### Time-Based Criteria

**Examples:**
- "Stocks with earnings in the next 2 weeks"
- "Stocks up 20%+ in the past month"
- "Stocks that IPO'd in the past 6 months"
- "Stocks with ex-dividend date this week"

**Dynamic criteria that update automatically**

---

### Relative Performance

**Examples:**
- "Stocks outperforming S&P 500 by 10%+ this year"
- "Tech stocks outperforming QQQ"
- "Stocks beating their sector average"

**Find leaders vs laggers**
