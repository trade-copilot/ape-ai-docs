## 🧠 How the AI Works

### Companion-Based Responses

Your AI adapts to your [chosen companion](../Companions/what-are-companions/):

**Example:** "Should I buy TSLA?"

**Money Monty (Generalist):**

> "TSLA looks solid from multiple angles. Technical strength with volume; fundamentals improving. Entry $465–470, target $490 in \~10 days. Risk: stretched valuation; size 2–3%."

**Maverick (Momentum Trader):**

> "TSLA breaking out with volume. Entry $465–470, target $490 in 7–10 days. Good swing setup."

**Sage (Long‑Term):**

> "TSLA Fundamental B-. Quality company, stretched valuation (P/E \~75). For long‑term: Wait for pullback to $400–420 or DCA."

**Blitz (Day Trader, advanced):**

> "TSLA near $470. Break with volume → $478 intraday. Consider short‑dated calls; stop at $458."

**Same question, companion‑specific answers—matching your style and timeframe.**

### What AI Analyzes

When you ask about a stock, AI looks at:

* **Price action** - Current and historical
* **Technical indicators** - RSI, MACD, moving averages
* **Fundamentals** - Earnings, P/E, growth
* **News** - Recent headlines and catalysts
* **Sentiment** - Analyst ratings, social chatter
* **Market context** - Overall market conditions

Then gives you a personalized answer.

## 💡 Pro Tips for Better Responses

### 1. Be Specific

❌ **Vague:** "Tell me about TSLA"&#x20;

✅ **Specific:** "Is TSLA a good swing trade entry at $465?"

### 2. Include Your Timeframe

❌ "Should I buy AAPL?"&#x20;

✅ "Should I buy AAPL for a 2-week swing trade?"

### 3. Mention Your Risk Tolerance

"Find me low-risk dividend stocks" "Show me high-risk options plays"

### 4. Ask Follow-Up Questions

**First:** "Analyze NVDA" **Follow-up:** "What's the downside risk?" **Follow-up:** "When should I exit?"

### 5. Use Context from Previous Messages

AI remembers your conversation: "What about compared to AMD?" "Should I wait for a pullback?"

❌ A replacement for your own research

### AI CAN:

✅ Analyze data quickly&#x20;

✅ Provide informed perspectives&#x20;

✅ Find opportunities you might miss&#x20;

✅ Explain complex concepts&#x20;
