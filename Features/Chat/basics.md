## 🧠 How the AI Works

### Persona-Based Responses

Your AI adapts to your [chosen persona](../Personas/what-are-personas.md):

**Example:** "Should I buy TSLA?"

**Blitz (Day Trader):**
> "TSLA at $465, momentum strong. Break above $470 targets $478. Consider calls exp Friday. Stop at $458."

**Maverick (Momentum Trader):**
> "TSLA breaking out with volume. Entry $465-470 range, target $490 in 7-10 days. Good swing setup."

**Sage (Long-Term):**
> "TSLA Fundamental B-. Great company but valuation stretched (P/E 75). For long-term: Wait for pullback to $400-420."

**Same question, different answers based on YOUR trading style!**

---

### What AI Analyzes

When you ask about a stock, AI looks at:
- **Price action** - Current and historical
- **Technical indicators** - RSI, MACD, moving averages
- **Fundamentals** - Earnings, P/E, growth
- **News** - Recent headlines and catalysts
- **Sentiment** - Analyst ratings, social chatter
- **Market context** - Overall market conditions

Then gives you a personalized answer.

## 💡 Pro Tips for Better Responses

### 1. Be Specific
❌ **Vague:** "Tell me about TSLA"
✅ **Specific:** "Is TSLA a good swing trade entry at $465?"

### 2. Include Your Timeframe
❌ "Should I buy AAPL?"
✅ "Should I buy AAPL for a 2-week swing trade?"

### 3. Mention Your Risk Tolerance
"Find me low-risk dividend stocks"
"Show me high-risk options plays"

### 4. Ask Follow-Up Questions
**First:** "Analyze NVDA"
**Follow-up:** "What's the downside risk?"
**Follow-up:** "When should I exit?"

### 5. Use Context from Previous Messages
AI remembers your conversation:
"What about compared to AMD?"
"Should I wait for a pullback?"
