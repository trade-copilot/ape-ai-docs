## 💡 How to Use News Effectively

### 1. Morning News Scan (3 minutes)

**Routine:**
1. Open Feed/Discover
2. Check **Breaking News** section
3. Scan headlines
4. Tap any relevant ones
5. Read full articles if interesting

**Look for:**
- Overnight news affecting your portfolio
- Pre-market movers with catalysts
- Sector trends
- Economic data releases

**Don't:**
- Read every single article
- Spend hours scrolling
- React to every headline

---

### 2. News → AI → Decision

**When you see interesting news:**

**Step 1: Read the headline**
> "TSLA Announces Cybertruck Delivery Event"

**Step 2: Ask AI about it**
Go to Chat tab, ask:
- "What does the Cybertruck news mean for TSLA stock?"
- "Should I buy TSLA before the delivery event?"
- "What's the risk if Cybertruck disappoints?"

**Step 3: Get AI analysis**
> AI: "TSLA Cybertruck event is priced in. Stock up 15% this month on hype. Risk/reward not great here. Wait for post-event dip if you want entry."

**Step 4: Make informed decision**

**News → Context → Smart decision**

---

### 3. Filter Noise from Signal

**Not every headline matters.**

**Ask yourself:**
1. **Does this affect my portfolio?** If no, skip.
2. **Is this actionable?** If no, skip.
3. **Is this time-sensitive?** If no, save for later.
4. **Does this change my thesis?** If no, skip.

**You'll save hours filtering this way.**
