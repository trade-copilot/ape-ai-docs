## 💡 Trading Strategies Using Trending

### 1. Momentum Fade Strategy (Blitz)

**When:** Stock is #1 on Top Gainers, up 20%+ with no news

**Strategy:**
- Stock probably overextended
- Wait for first pullback
- Short or buy puts
- Quick scalp back down 5-10%

**Risk:** Momentum can continue longer than you think

---

### 2. Early Momentum Catch (Maverick)

**When:** Stock appears on Most Searched + Highest Volume + Small price move (only +2-3%)

**Strategy:**
- Momentum building but hasn't exploded yet
- Buy early before FOMO kicks in
- Hold for multi-day move
- Exit when it hits Top Gainers (late)

**Risk:** Might not explode. Use stop loss.

---

### 3. WSB Fade (Advanced)

**When:** Stock trending on Social with 90%+ bullish sentiment

**Strategy:**
- WSB is usually late
- Wait 1-2 days
- Short when hype peaks
- Cover when sentiment turns

**Risk:** Risky. WSB can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

**Not for beginners!**

---

### 4. Sector Rotation Play (Sage)

**When:** Multiple stocks from same sector in Top Gainers

**Strategy:**
- Identify sector rotation (Tech hot, Energy cold)
- Buy quality names in hot sector
- Hold for weeks/months
- Ride the trend

**Risk:** Sector rotations can reverse quickly

---

### 5. Gap & Go (Blitz)

**When:** Stock in Pre-Market Movers with strong catalyst (earnings beat, FDA approval)

**Strategy:**
- Stock gaps up at open on news
- Buy the breakout at 9:30-9:45 AM
- Ride the momentum
- Exit by 11 AM (before lunch chop)

**Risk:** Gap can fill. Use stop below gap level.

## ⚠️ Trending Stock Warnings

### 1. FOMO is Dangerous
**Just because everyone's talking about it doesn't mean you should buy it.**

- Most retail traders are late
- You see it trending = you're probably late too
- Wait for YOUR setup, not someone else's

---

### 2. Pump & Dumps
**Small cap stocks with huge social buzz = red flag**

- Check market cap
- Low volume stocks can be manipulated
- If it's under $500M market cap and trending on WSB, be careful

**Trade with caution or avoid entirely.**

---

### 3. Volume ≠ Good Trade
**High volume means interest, not necessarily opportunity**

- Volume can be people exiting (selling)
- High volume on down days = distribution
- Context matters

**Always check WHY volume is high.**

---

### 4. Lagging Indicator
**By the time it's trending, move might be over**

- Trending shows what WAS happening
- Not what WILL happen
- Use it for ideas, not signals

**Still need to do your own analysis.**
