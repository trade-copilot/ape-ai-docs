## ⚠️ Important Limitations

### Grades Are NOT Perfect

**Remember:**
1. **AI analyzes data, not magic**
   - Based on available info
   - Can't predict black swans
   - Historical data, not future guarantees

2. **Grades change**
   - Market conditions shift
   - Company situations evolve
   - What's A today might be C tomorrow

3. **Context matters**
   - F grade might be oversold opportunity
   - A grade might be overvalued momentum play
   - Your strategy determines what grades you want

4. **Still need to think**
   - Grades are a tool, not the answer
   - Do your own research
   - Understand what you're buying

**Grades help, but don't blindly follow.**

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Filter by Grades

**When screening stocks:**
- Start with A & B grades
- Quickly eliminate obvious bad picks
- Saves hours of research

**Example:** "Show me tech stocks with Overall Grade A or B and P/E under 25"

---

### 2. Grade Disagreements = Opportunities

**When grades conflict:**
- Fundamental A, Technical F = Oversold quality? Buy opportunity?
- Fundamental F, Technical A = Momentum play, don't hold long
- Sentiment A, Technical D = Hype without substance?

**Disagreements often mean something interesting is happening.**

---

### 3. Track Grade History

**Watch grade evolution:**
- Consistent A's = stable quality
- A → B → C = deteriorating (sell)
- F → D → C = improving (bottom forming?)

**Trends matter more than single snapshot.**

---

### 4. Sort Portfolio by Grades

**Monthly portfolio review:**
1. Sort holdings by Overall Grade
2. See D & F grades at bottom
3. Ask: "Why do I still own these?"
4. Consider trimming weak grades

**Don't let losers drag down your portfolio.**
