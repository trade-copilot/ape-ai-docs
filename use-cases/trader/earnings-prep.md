## Understanding Earnings Trading

### What is Earnings Season?

**Quarterly cycle:**
- Q1 Earnings: April-May
- Q2 Earnings: July-August
- Q3 Earnings: October-November
- Q4 Earnings: January-February

**Peak weeks:**
- 2-3 week period when most companies report
- 500+ companies reporting per week
- High volatility environment
- Outsized moves (±10-20% common)

### Why Earnings Matter

**Quarterly earnings reports include:**
- Revenue (sales)
- EPS (earnings per share)
- Forward guidance
- Business updates
- Q&A with analysts

**Stock reactions:**
- Beat expectations → Usually up ✅
- Miss expectations → Usually down ❌
- Beat but guide lower → Often down ⚠️
- Miss but guide higher → Sometimes up 🤔

**But it's not always logical!**
- Market expectations > actual numbers
- Guidance matters more than past quarter

## Earnings Season Calendar Strategy

### Peak Weeks Approach

**Week 1-2 of Earnings Season:**
- Market testing waters
- Early reports set tone
- Moderate volatility

**Strategy:**
- Selective plays
- Smaller size
- Test the environment

**Week 3-4 (Peak):**
- 300-500 reports per week
- Highest volatility
- Most opportunities

**Strategy:**
- Most active
- Full position sizing
- Best setups

**Week 5-6 (Tail End):**
- Stragglers reporting
- Volatility fading
- Fewer opportunities

**Strategy:**
- Wind down
- Cherry-pick only
- Smaller size again

### Sector Rotation During Earnings

**Watch sector leadership:**

**Early Earnings:**
- Financials (JPM, BAC, GS)
- Set tone for risk appetite

**Mid Earnings:**
- Tech mega-caps (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, etc.)
- Drive market direction

**Late Earnings:**
- Retail (WMT, TGT, AMZN)
- Consumer health check

**Strategy:**
- Follow the leadership
- Weak sector = avoid
- Strong sector = focus

---

## Risk Management for Earnings

### Position Sizing

**Reduce size for earnings trades:**

```
Normal swing trade: 2% risk
Earnings trade: 1-1.5% risk

Why: Higher volatility, binary risk
```

**Example:**
```
Account: $50,000
Normal risk: $1,000 (2%)
Earnings risk: $750 (1.5%)

TSLA trade:
Entry: $250
Stop: $246
Risk per share: $4

Position: $750 ÷ $4 = 187 shares
(Rounded to 50 shares for this example)
```

### Maximum Exposure

**Limit total earnings exposure:**

```
Max earnings positions: 2-3 at once
Max total risk: 3-4% of account
```

**Why:**
- Correlated moves (tech all moves together)
- Multiple binary events
- Can't manage too many
- Preserve capital

### Stop Losses Are Mandatory

**Always use stops on earnings trades:**

**Technical stop:**
- Below gap fill level
- Below key support
- Below recent low

**Percentage stop:**
- 2-3% from entry (tight)
- Wider if large gap up

**Time stop:**
- Exit if no progress in 3-5 days
- Don't let winner become loser
- Move on to next opportunity

**Wait for clarity. Enter with conviction. Exit with discipline.**
