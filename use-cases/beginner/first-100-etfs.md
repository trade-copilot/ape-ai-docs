### Long-Term Investment Plan

**For Your First $100:**
- Hold for minimum 5 years
- Ideally 10-20+ years
- Let compound growth work

**Next Steps:**

**Month 2-6: Add More Regularly**
```
- Invest $100/month
- Same ETF or new ones
- Dollar-cost averaging
- Don't try to time the market
```

**After 6 Months: Consider Diversification**
```
If starting with VOO:
- 70% VOO (S&P 500)
- 20% VEA (International)
- 10% BND (Bonds)
```

### Ask Sage for Your Plan

**Type:**

## Understanding ETF Basics

### How ETFs Make Money

**1. Capital Appreciation**
- ETF price goes up over time
- Sell for profit later
- Main return driver

**2. Dividends**
- Companies pay dividends
- ETF collects and distributes
- Usually quarterly
- Can reinvest automatically

**Example:**
```
VOO typical annual dividend: ~1.5%

Your $100 investment:
- Year 1 dividends: ~$1.50
- Reinvest automatically
- Compounds over time
```

**💡 Tip:** Set up automatic dividend reinvestment (DRIP) to buy more shares automatically!

### ETF Rebalancing

**What happens automatically:**
- Index changes holdings
- ETF manager adjusts to match
- You don't do anything
- No tax impact while holding

**You only rebalance when:**
- You own multiple ETFs
- Allocations drift from target
- Typically once per year

---

## Common Questions

### "Should I invest all at once or wait?"

**Time in market > Timing the market**

**Best approach:**
- Invest the $100 now
- Add more regularly (monthly)
- Dollar-cost averaging
- Don't wait for "perfect" timing

**Why?**
- Markets trend up long-term
- Missing best days hurts returns
- Consistency beats perfect timing

### "What if market crashes after I buy?"

**This will happen eventually!**

**The right mindset:**
- Crashes = buying opportunities
- Your time horizon is 10+ years
- Market always recovers
- Stay the course

**Historical fact:**
- S&P 500 has recovered from every crash
- Average 10% annual returns since 1957
- Short-term pain, long-term gain

**Ask Sage:**
```
The market just dropped 10%. Should I sell my ETFs?
```

Sage will remind you why holding is usually best!

### "How many different ETFs should I own?"

**For $100: Just 1 ETF is perfect**
- Simplicity is key
- Already diversified
- Easy to track

**As you invest more:**
- 2-3 ETFs: Good diversification
- 5-7 ETFs: Plenty of diversity
- 10+ ETFs: Probably overdoing it

**Simple is better:**
- VTI alone covers 3,500 stocks
- Adding more doesn't always help
- Lower fees, simpler management

## Monitoring Your Investment

### How Often to Check

**Recommended Schedule:**
- **First month:** Weekly (get comfortable)
- **Months 2-6:** Bi-weekly
- **After 6 months:** Monthly
- **Long-term:** Quarterly

**What NOT to do:**
- ❌ Check price multiple times daily
- ❌ Panic when it's down 2%
- ❌ Celebrate when it's up 3%

**Why?**
- Daily volatility is noise
- Long-term trend is what matters
- Reduces emotional decisions

### What to Monitor

**Quarterly Check-In:**
- Overall performance
- Dividend payments
- Any major news
- Stay invested!

**Annual Review:**
- Compare to benchmark
- Consider rebalancing
- Adjust contributions
- Update goals

### Portfolio View

**In Ape AI:**
- Go to **Portfolio** tab
- See your ETF position
- View:
  - Current value
  - Total return
  - Dividend income
  - Cost basis

## Advanced Strategies (After First $100)

### Tax-Advantaged Accounts

**Once comfortable with ETFs:**

**Roth IRA (Best for long-term)**
- Contributions: After-tax money
- Growth: Tax-free
- Withdrawals: Tax-free in retirement
- Limit: $7,000/year (2025)

**Traditional IRA**
- Contributions: Tax-deductible
- Growth: Tax-deferred
- Withdrawals: Taxed in retirement

**401(k)**
- Employer retirement account
- Often has company match
- Similar to traditional IRA

**💡 Tip:** ETFs in Roth IRA = maximum long-term wealth building!

### Asset Allocation by Age

**Sage's general guidelines:**

**Age 20-30:**
- 90-100% stocks
- 0-10% bonds
- Maximum growth

**Age 30-40:**
- 80-90% stocks
- 10-20% bonds
- Aggressive growth

**Age 40-50:**
- 70-80% stocks
- 20-30% bonds
- Balanced growth

**Age 50-60:**
- 60-70% stocks
- 30-40% bonds
- Preservation + growth

**Age 60+:**
- 50-60% stocks
- 40-50% bonds
- Income + preservation

**Rule of thumb:** 120 - your age = % in stocks

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This

**1. Selling during market drops**
- Locks in losses
- Misses recovery
- Destroys long-term returns

**2. Chasing hot sector ETFs**
- What's hot today cools tomorrow
- Broad market is safer
- Speculation ≠ Investing

**3. Overcomplicating with too many ETFs**
- 1-3 ETFs is enough
- More ≠ Better diversification
- Keep it simple

**4. Ignoring expense ratios**
- 0.50% vs 0.03% is huge over time
- On $10,000 over 30 years:
  - 0.03% = $225 in fees
  - 0.50% = $3,750 in fees

**5. Trying to time the market**
- "Wait for a dip" often backfires
- Time in market > Timing market
- Consistent investing wins
