### Step 2: Ask AI for a Beginner Trade Idea (10 minutes)

**Open Chat and ask:**

> "I'm a complete beginner. Suggest a simple first trade for me with $200."

**AI Response Example:**
> "Great choice to start small! Here's a beginner-friendly first trade:
>
> **Stock:** Apple (AAPL)
> **Current Price:** $268
> **Trade Type:** Buy 1 share
> **Cost:** ~$268
> **Why Apple:**
> - Stable, well-known company
> - Less volatile than most stocks
> - Good for learning
>
> **Simple Plan:**
> - **Buy:** 1 share at market price ($268)
> - **Target:** Sell at $280 (+4.5% gain = $12 profit)
> - **Time:** Hold for 1-4 weeks
> - **Risk:** Low - Apple rarely drops more than 5-10%
>
> **What you'll learn:**
> - How to place an order
> - How to track a position
> - How to sell for profit
>
> Would you like me to help you execute this trade?"

**Important:** AI chooses simple, stable stocks for beginners - usually large companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.

---

### Step 3: Understand What You're Buying (5 minutes)

**Before buying, ask AI to explain:**

> "Explain Apple stock to me like I'm 5 years old"

**AI Explanation:**
> "Apple Stock (AAPL) Explained Simply:
>
> **What is it?**
> When you buy Apple stock, you own a tiny piece of Apple Inc. (the iPhone company).
>
> **How do you make money?**
> If Apple does well → Stock price goes up → You sell for more than you paid → Profit!
>
> **Example:**
> - You buy 1 share for $268
> - Apple releases great product
> - People buy more iPhones
> - Stock goes to $280
> - You sell for $280
> - You made $12!
>
> **Risk:**
> - Stock can go down too
> - If drops to $250, you lose $18
> - That's why we set a 'stop' to limit losses
>
> Make sense? Ready to buy your first share?"

**Take your time here.** Don't rush into a trade you don't understand.

## ⚠️ Important Beginner Warnings

### Warning 1: Don't Get Greedy
**Problem:** First trade makes $12, next trade you risk $2,000
**Solution:** Increase slowly. Don't jump from $200 to $2,000.

**Suggested progression:**
- Trades 1-5: $200-500
- Trades 6-10: $500-1000
- Trades 11-20: $1000-2000
- After that: Scale based on success

---

### Warning 2: Losses Will Happen
**Reality:** Not every trade wins
- Your first trade made +4.5%
- Your 3rd trade might lose -2%
- **That's normal!**

**Good traders:**
- Win 60-70% of trades
- Lose 30-40% of trades
- Still profitable overall

---

### Warning 3: Don't Chase Hot Stocks
**Temptation:** See stock up 50% today, want to buy
**Problem:** You're buying at the top
**Solution:** Stick to AI's beginner recommendations (stable stocks)

**AI will suggest:**
- Apple, Microsoft, Amazon
- Large, stable companies
- Not meme stocks or crypto

---

### Warning 4: Paper Trading vs Real Money
**If you started with paper trading:**
- Emotions are different with real money
- First real trade: Use same small amount ($200-500)
- Don't assume paper success = real success immediately

**Transition plan:**
- Paper: 5-10 successful trades
- Real: Start with $200
- Gradually increase as you prove consistency

---

## 🚧 Troubleshooting

### "Execute Trade" Button Not Showing

**Cause 1:** Trading permissions not enabled
- **Fix:** Go to Settings → Enable trading

**Cause 2:** AI didn't give specific trade setup
- **Fix:** Ask: "Give me exact entry price for AAPL"

**Cause 3:** Brokerage not connected
- **Fix:** [Connect brokerage →](../../features/brokerage/connecting.md)

---

### Order Rejected

**Possible reasons:**
1. **Insufficient funds**
   - Fix: Buy fewer shares or add funds
2. **Market closed**
   - Fix: Wait for market hours (9:30 AM - 4 PM ET)
3. **Stock halted**
   - Fix: Ask AI for alternative stock

---

### Filled at Different Price

**Example:** Ordered at $268, filled at $268.50

**Why:** Market orders fill at current price (moves fast)

**Solution for next time:**
- Use limit orders
- Set max price you're willing to pay
- AI can help: "Place limit order for AAPL at $268"

---

### Price Dropped After I Bought

**Example:** Bought at $268, now at $265 (-$3 loss)

**Don't panic! Ask AI:**
> "My AAPL is down $3. Should I sell or hold?"

**AI Response:**
> "AAPL down 1.1% - normal fluctuation. Setup still intact. Your target is $280. Recommendation: Hold. Check again in 3-5 days."

**Key:** Don't make emotional decisions. Trust the plan!
