---

## The Big Question: How Much Should You Start With?

### The Short Answer

**You can start with as little as $1.**

Modern brokerages allow fractional shares, meaning you can buy 0.01 shares of expensive stocks like Apple or Tesla.

### The Realistic Answer

**Most successful beginner investors start with $100-$1,000.**

**Why this range?**
- Large enough to feel real (not just "play money")
- Small enough that a mistake won't devastate you
- Allows diversification across 2-3 investments
- Psychological sweet spot for learning

### The Wrong Answers

**❌ "I'll start when I have $10,000"**
- You'll keep waiting and never start
- Missing out on compound interest NOW
- Time in market > perfect amount

**❌ "I'll invest my entire savings ($25,000)"**
- Too risky for a beginner
- Need emergency fund first
- Should keep 3-6 months expenses in cash

**❌ "I'll start with $10 to test it out"**
- Too small to feel meaningful
- Won't learn proper risk management
- Brokerage fees may eat returns

---

## The Smart Starting Amount Framework

### Step 1: Calculate Your Emergency Fund Gap

**Rule: Have 3-6 months of expenses in savings BEFORE investing.**

**Quick calculation:**

```
Monthly expenses: $________
× 3 months minimum = $________
× 6 months comfortable = $________

Current savings: $________
Emergency fund gap: $________ (if negative, build this first!)
```

**Example:**

Sarah's monthly expenses: $2,500
× 6 months = $15,000 needed in emergency fund
Current savings: $8,000
Emergency fund gap: $7,000 (she needs to save more before investing)

**If your gap is POSITIVE (you have enough emergency fund):**
✅ You're ready to invest! Continue to next step.

**If your gap is NEGATIVE (you need more emergency fund):**
- Option 1: Build emergency fund first, then invest (safest)
- Option 2: Split contributions (50% emergency fund, 50% investing)
- Option 3: Start with tiny amount ($100) while building emergency fund

---

### Step 2: Determine Your Initial Investment Amount

**Use this decision tree:**

**Total liquid savings after emergency fund:**

**$0-$500:**
- **Invest:** $50-$100
- **Strategy:** Single diversified ETF (VTI or VOO)
- **Focus:** Learning and building habit

**$500-$2,000:**
- **Invest:** $200-$500
- **Strategy:** 2-3 diversified ETFs or start building portfolio
- **Focus:** Diversification basics

**$2,000-$5,000:**
- **Invest:** $500-$1,000
- **Strategy:** Diversified portfolio (3-5 holdings)
- **Focus:** Portfolio construction and rebalancing

**$5,000-$10,000:**
- **Invest:** $1,000-$2,000
- **Strategy:** Full portfolio (stocks, bonds, international)
- **Focus:** Asset allocation and long-term strategy

**$10,000+:**
- **Invest:** $2,000-$5,000 initially
- **Strategy:** Systematic approach, dollar-cost averaging
- **Focus:** Tax optimization, multiple accounts

**The Rule:** Don't invest more than 25% of your liquid savings on your first investment.

**Why?**
- Preserves flexibility
- Allows learning with smaller stakes
- Reduces emotional impact of losses
- Can add more after gaining confidence

---

### Step 3: Choose Your Funding Strategy

**One-time Lump Sum**
- Transfer initial amount
- Invest it all at once or gradually
- Good for: Starting out, specific goal amount

**Recurring Deposits (Dollar-Cost Averaging)**
- Set up automatic monthly transfers
- $100, $250, $500, or $1,000/month
- Good for: Building wealth systematically, reducing timing risk

**Combination Approach (Recommended)**
- Start with initial lump sum ($500-$1,000)
- Set up automatic monthly deposits ($100-$500)
- Best of both: Start now + build consistently

## Setting Up Recurring Deposits (Dollar-Cost Averaging)

### Why Recurring Deposits?

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Automate wealth building
- ✅ Remove emotions from investing
- ✅ Dollar-cost averaging (buy at different prices)
- ✅ Build consistent habit
- ✅ "Pay yourself first" mentality

**The Math:**

**$500/month for 30 years at 10% return = $1,026,792**
**$1,000/month for 30 years at 10% return = $2,053,584**

This is the power of consistent, automated investing.

---

### Choosing Your Recurring Amount

**Calculate based on income:**

**The 50/30/20 Rule:**
- 50% of income: Needs (rent, food, utilities)
- 30% of income: Wants (entertainment, dining out)
- 20% of income: Savings and investing

**Example:**

Monthly take-home pay: $4,000
- 50% needs = $2,000
- 30% wants = $1,200
- 20% savings = $800

**Split the 20%:**
- Emergency fund: $400
- Investing: $400

**So this person should set up $400/month recurring investment.**

---

**Scale based on your situation:**

| Monthly Take-Home | 20% Savings | Suggested Recurring Deposit |
|-------------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| $2,000 | $400 | $200-300 investing |
| $3,000 | $600 | $300-400 investing |
| $4,000 | $800 | $400-500 investing |
| $5,000 | $1,000 | $500-700 investing |
| $7,500 | $1,500 | $800-1,000 investing |
| $10,000 | $2,000 | $1,000-1,500 investing |

**Remember:** This is after you have a solid emergency fund (3-6 months expenses).

---

## Common Funding Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Investing Money You'll Need Soon

**The scenario:**
- You have $5,000 saved
- You know you need $3,000 for a car repair in 2 months
- You invest all $5,000 in stocks

**Why it's bad:**
- Stock market is volatile short-term
- Might be down 10% when you need the money
- Forced to sell at a loss

**The fix:**
- Only invest money you won't need for 3-5+ years
- Keep short-term money in high-yield savings account
- Rule: If you'll need it within 3 years, don't invest it

---

### Mistake #2: No Emergency Fund

**The scenario:**
- You have $2,000 in savings
- You invest all $2,000 in stocks
- Car breaks down - needs $1,500 repair
- You have to sell stocks at a loss to pay for repair

**Why it's bad:**
- Emergency forces you to sell investments at wrong time
- Might sell at a loss
- Defeats purpose of long-term investing

**The fix:**
- Keep 3-6 months of expenses in savings FIRST
- Then invest additional money
- Emergency fund = peace of mind

---

### Mistake #3: Trying to Time the Market

**The scenario:**
- You have $5,000 ready to invest
- Market drops 5% and you think "I'll wait for it to drop more"
- Market goes up 20% over next year
- You missed the entire gain waiting for a bigger drop

**Why it's bad:**
- Impossible to time the market perfectly
- Time IN the market > Timing the market
- Every day you wait is potential compound interest lost

**The fix:**
- Invest as soon as you have the money
- Or use dollar-cost averaging (invest gradually over 3-6 months)
- Don't try to predict short-term movements

---

### Mistake #4: Depositing Too Much Too Fast (FOMO)

**The scenario:**
- Your friend tells you about a "hot stock"
- You deposit your entire savings ($20,000) immediately
- You buy the stock without research
- Stock drops 30%
- You panic sell at a loss

**Why it's bad:**
- Emotional investing leads to bad decisions
- No diversification
- Acting on tips instead of research
- Too much at stake for beginner

**The fix:**
- Start with smaller amount ($500-$2,000)
- Learn with manageable stakes
- Gradually increase as you gain experience and confidence
- Do your own research

---

### Mistake #5: Not Setting Up Recurring Deposits

**The scenario:**
- You invest $1,000 once
- You forget about it
- Never add more money
- Miss out on compound interest from regular contributions

**Why it's bad:**
- One-time deposits grow slower than regular contributions
- Requires discipline to manually deposit each month
- Easy to forget or "skip a month"

**Example comparison:**

**One-time $1,000:**
- After 30 years at 10%: $17,449

**$1,000 initial + $50/month:**
- After 30 years at 10%: $116,858

**Difference: $99,409 from just $50/month!**

**The fix:**
- Set up automatic recurring deposits on Day 1
- Treat it like a bill that must be paid
- "Pay yourself first" mindset

---

### Mistake #6: Wrong Transfer Method (Paying Unnecessary Fees)

**The scenario:**
- You wire transfer $500 to your brokerage
- Wire fee: $30
- That's 6% of your investment gone immediately!

**Why it's bad:**
- Wire fees are significant for small amounts
- ACH transfers are free and only take 3-5 days
- No reason to pay fee for regular deposits

**The fix:**
- Use free ACH transfers for regular deposits
- Only use wires for:
  - Large amounts ($50,000+)
  - Time-sensitive situations
  - When percentage fee is tiny (30 on $100,000 = 0.03%)
