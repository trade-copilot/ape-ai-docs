## What is a Brokerage?

### The Simple Explanation

**Brokerage = The company that lets you buy and sell investments**

Think of it like:
- **Amazon** for physical products
- **Brokerage** for stocks, bonds, ETFs

You can't buy stocks directly from companies. You need a middleman (broker) to execute trades on your behalf.

### What Brokerages Do

**Main functions:**
1. **Execute trades** - Buy/sell stocks, ETFs, options, bonds
2. **Hold your assets** - Store your investments safely
3. **Provide information** - Charts, research, market data
4. **Offer tools** - Trading platforms, mobile apps, analysis

**They make money from:**
- Payment for order flow (selling your orders to market makers)
- Margin interest (if you borrow money)
- Premium subscriptions (advanced tools)
- Managed accounts (robo-advisors)

## Paper Trading vs Real Money Trading

### What is Paper Trading?

**Paper Trading = Practice trading with fake money**

**How it works:**
- You get virtual money ($10,000-100,000)
- Buy and sell real stocks in real-time
- Track your performance
- Learn without risking real money
- Make mistakes safely

**Think of it like:**
- A flight simulator before flying a real plane
- Practice driving before getting on the highway
- Video game mode before competing

### Why Start with Paper Trading?

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Zero risk** - Can't lose real money
- ✅ **Learn mechanics** - How to place orders, read charts
- ✅ **Test strategies** - Try different approaches
- ✅ **Build confidence** - Get comfortable before going live
- ✅ **Make mistakes** - Learn from errors without consequences
- ✅ **Emotional training** - Experience ups and downs

**Statistics:**
- 90% of new traders lose money in their first year
- Paper trading reduces that to ~70%
- Saves $1,000s in beginner mistakes
