## Options Trading Basics

### What Are Options?

**Options = Contracts giving you the RIGHT (not obligation) to buy or sell stock**

**Two types:**
- **Call Option:** Right to BUY stock at strike price
  - You profit if stock goes UP
  - Bullish play

- **Put Option:** Right to SELL stock at strike price
  - You profit if stock goes DOWN
  - Bearish play

**Key Terms:**
- **Strike Price:** The price you can buy/sell at
- **Expiration Date:** When the option expires (worthless if not profitable)
- **Premium:** What you pay for the contract
- **Contract:** Controls 100 shares of stock

**Example:**
```
AAPL $180 Call expiring 12/20
- You pay $5.00 per share ($500 per contract)
- Right to buy 100 shares of AAPL at $180
- Expires December 20th
- Profitable if AAPL > $185 by expiration
- Max loss: $500 (100%)
```

### Why Trade Options?

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Leverage: Control $10,000 of stock for $500
- ✅ Defined risk: Max loss = premium paid
- ✅ Flexibility: Profit from up, down, or sideways
- ✅ Lower capital required than stocks

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Time decay: Lose value every day
- ❌ Can lose 100% if wrong
- ❌ More complex than stocks
- ❌ Less liquid (harder to exit)

```

---

## Step 3: Choose Strike Price and Expiration

### Understanding Strike Selection

**In-The-Money (ITM):**
- Strike below current price (calls)
- More expensive, less leverage
- Higher delta, moves more with stock
- **Good for:** Lower risk, beginners

**At-The-Money (ATM):**
- Strike near current price
- Balanced cost and leverage
- Medium delta (~0.50)
- **Good for:** Most situations, first trade

**Out-of-The-Money (OTM):**
- Strike above current price (calls)
- Cheaper, more leverage
- Lower delta, needs big move
- **Good for:** Experienced, high conviction

**For Your First Trade: Use ATM or slightly ITM**

**Example:**
```
AAPL at $175.50:

ITM: $170 Call = $8.00 ($800) - Safer
ATM: $175 Call = $5.50 ($550) - Balanced ✓
OTM: $180 Call = $3.50 ($350) - Riskier
OTM: $185 Call = $2.00 ($200) - Very risky
```

### Choosing Expiration

**Time to Expiration (DTE = Days to Expiration):**

**Weekly (7 DTE):**
- Cheapest
- Highest risk (time decay)
- Need to be RIGHT and FAST
- **For:** Experienced day traders only

**2-3 Weeks (14-21 DTE):**
- Good balance
- Enough time for setup to work
- Not too expensive
- **For:** Active swing traders ✓

**30-45 DTE:**
- More expensive
- Time to be patient
- Lower time decay stress
- **For:** Position traders, beginners ✓

**60+ DTE (LEAPS):**
- Most expensive
- Lowest time decay
- More like stock substitute
- **For:** Long-term bullish

**For Your First Trade: 2-4 weeks out (14-30 DTE)**

- IV not extremely high (< 50%)

✅ **Strike Makes Sense**

- 5-10% move from current price
- Above key resistance

---

## Step 5: Execute the Trade

### Order Entry

**Order Type Selection:**

**Market Order**
- ❌ NOT recommended for options
- Wide bid-ask spreads
- Instant execution
- Pay more than needed

**Limit Order**
- ✅ RECOMMENDED
- Set max price you'll pay
- Better fill price
- Might not fill immediately

**For Options: ALWAYS use Limit orders**

### Setting Your Limit Price

**Strategy:**
```
1. Check current Bid: $5.45 / Ask: $5.55
2. Start with mid-price: $5.50
3. If not filling, increase by $0.05
4. Max: Ask price ($5.55)
```

### Place the Order

1. Tap **"Execute trade"** on setup card
2. Verify:
   - ✅ Correct ticker (AAPL)
   - ✅ Correct strike ($175)
   - ✅ Correct expiration (12/20)
   - ✅ CALL (not put!)
   - ✅ BUY TO OPEN (not sell!)
   - ✅ Quantity: 1 contract
   - ✅ Limit price: $5.50

3. Review total cost: $550 + fees
4. Confirm order
5. Wait for fill

**💡 Tip:** If order doesn't fill in 30 seconds, increase limit price by $0.05 and resubmit.

---

## Step 6: Manage the Trade

### Set Your Exits IMMEDIATELY

**As soon as filled:**

**1. Profit Target**
- Set at 50-100% gain
- Example: Bought at $5.50, sell at $8.25-11.00
- Use Limit order to sell

**2. Stop Loss**
- Set at 30-50% loss
- Example: Bought at $5.50, sell if < $2.75-3.50
- Use Stop-Limit order

**3. Time Stop**
- Plan to exit by X date
- Don't hold into last week before expiration
- Time decay accelerates

**Maverick's Exit Plan:**
```
Entry: $5.50

Exits:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ Target 1: $8.25 (50% gain) - Sell half
✓ Target 2: $11.00 (100% gain) - Sell rest
✗ Stop Loss: $3.50 (36% loss)
⏰ Time Stop: Exit by 12/15 (5 days before exp)

Don't hold through:
- Major resistance
- Earnings (if before exp)
- Last 3 days before expiration
```

### Daily Monitoring

**What to watch:**

**Stock Price:**
- Check once at open, once at close
- Don't micromanage intraday

**Option Value:**
- Track if nearing targets
- Don't panic on small moves

**Time Decay:**
- Accelerates in final week
- Exit if not working by halfway point

**Technical Levels:**
- If stock breaks support = reassess
- If hits target = consider taking profit

Review my AAPL call trade. I bought $175 call
at $5.50, sold at $8.00. What could I improve?
```

### Keep a Trade Journal

**Log every options trade:**
```
Date: 11/15/2025
