---

## Why Multi-Account Management Matters

### The Common Scenario

**Typical investor has 5-8 accounts:**

1. **Employer 401(k)** (current job) - $120,000
2. **Old 401(k)** (previous job) - $45,000
3. **Traditional IRA** (rollover from old job) - $30,000
4. **Roth IRA** (personal contributions) - $25,000
5. **Taxable Brokerage** (Robinhood) - $35,000
6. **HSA** (Health Savings Account) - $8,000
7. **Spouse's 401(k)** - $90,000
8. **Joint Taxable Account** - $50,000

**Total: $403,000 across 8 accounts!**

### The Problems Without Unified Management

**Problem #1: Don't know your true allocation**

**Example:**
- 401(k) is 60% stocks, 40% bonds
- IRA is 80% stocks, 20% bonds
- Taxable is 100% stocks
- **What's your ACTUAL allocation?**
- Most people don't know! (It's ~73% stocks, 27% bonds)

**Problem #2: Unintentional over-concentration**

**Example:**
- 401(k): Heavy in tech (company match in company stock)
- Roth IRA: Bought AAPL, MSFT, NVDA
- Taxable: Bought QQQ (tech-heavy)
- **Actual exposure:** 45% tech sector! (WAY too concentrated)

**Problem #3: Missing rebalancing opportunities**

**Example:**
- Stocks up 30% (now overweight overall)
- But you rebalance each account individually to 60/40
- Result: Still overweight stocks when viewed holistically
- Missed opportunity to truly rebalance

**Problem #4: Inefficient contributions**

**Example:**
- Adding $1,000/month
- Splitting equally across all accounts
- Result: Small additions to many accounts, can't buy full shares
- Better: Concentrate contributions strategically

## Step 1: Inventory All Accounts

### Create Your Account Master List

**Use a spreadsheet (Google Sheets recommended):**

| Account Name | Institution | Account Type | Current Balance | % of Total | Login URL |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|------------|-----------|
| John 401(k) | Fidelity | Traditional 401(k) | $120,000 | 29.8% | fidelity.com |
| Jane 401(k) | Vanguard | Traditional 401(k) | $90,000 | 22.3% | vanguard.com |
| Old 401(k) | T. Rowe Price | Traditional 401(k) | $45,000 | 11.2% | troweprice.com |
| John Trad IRA | Schwab | Traditional IRA | $30,000 | 7.4% | schwab.com |
| John Roth IRA | Schwab | Roth IRA | $25,000 | 6.2% | schwab.com |
| Joint Brokerage | Robinhood | Taxable | $50,000 | 12.4% | robinhood.com |
| John Brokerage | Fidelity | Taxable | $35,000 | 8.7% | fidelity.com |
| John HSA | Fidelity | HSA | $8,000 | 2.0% | fidelity.com |
| **TOTAL** | | | **$403,000** | **100%** | |

**Include:**
- Account owner (John, Jane, Joint)
- Institution
- Account type (tax treatment)
- Current balance
- Percentage of total portfolio
- Login info (for easy access)

**Frequency:** Update balances monthly (1st of month)

---

### Step 2: Inventory All Holdings

**Create Holdings Master List:**

| Account | Ticker | Asset Class | Shares/Units | Current Value | % of Account | % of Total Portfolio |
|---------|--------|-------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|----------------------|
| John 401(k) | Target Date 2055 | Mixed | N/A | $120,000 | 100% | 29.8% |
| Jane 401(k) | VTSAX | U.S. Stock | 250 | $63,000 | 70% | 15.6% |
| Jane 401(k) | VBMFX | U.S. Bond | 500 | $27,000 | 30% | 6.7% |
| Old 401(k) | Various | Mixed | N/A | $45,000 | 100% | 11.2% |
| John Trad IRA | VTI | U.S. Stock | 100 | $22,000 | 73% | 5.5% |
| John Trad IRA | BND | U.S. Bond | 100 | $8,000 | 27% | 2.0% |
| John Roth IRA | VWO | EM Stock | 500 | $25,000 | 100% | 6.2% |
| Joint Brokerage | VTI | U.S. Stock | 150 | $33,000 | 66% | 8.2% |
| Joint Brokerage | VXUS | Intl Stock | 100 | $17,000 | 34% | 4.2% |
| John Brokerage | AAPL | U.S. Stock | 50 | $10,000 | 28.6% | 2.5% |
| John Brokerage | MSFT | U.S. Stock | 25 | $10,000 | 28.6% | 2.5% |
| John Brokerage | NVDA | U.S. Stock | 10 | $15,000 | 42.9% | 3.7% |
| John HSA | VTI | U.S. Stock | 30 | $6,600 | 82.5% | 1.6% |
| John HSA | BND | U.S. Bond | 15 | $1,400 | 17.5% | 0.3% |

**Note:** This is detailed! But necessary to understand your TRUE holdings.

---

### Step 3: Calculate True Asset Allocation

**Consolidate by asset class:**

| Asset Class | Total Value | % of Portfolio |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| U.S. Stocks | $279,600 | 69.4% |
| International Stocks | $17,000 | 4.2% |
| Emerging Markets | $25,000 | 6.2% |
| Bonds | $36,400 | 9.0% |
| Target Date Funds (mix) | $45,000 | 11.2% |
| **TOTAL** | **$403,000** | **100%** |

**Breakdown target date fund** (assumed 80% stocks, 20% bonds):
- Stocks from TDF: $36,000 (80% of $45k)
- Bonds from TDF: $9,000 (20% of $45k)

**TRUE allocation:**
- **Total Stocks:** $279.6k + $17k + $25k + $36k = $357,600 = **88.7%**
- **Total Bonds:** $36.4k + $9k = $45,400 = **11.3%**

**Uh oh!** You thought you were 60/40, but you're actually 89/11!

**This is why unified tracking matters!**

---

## Step 4: Set Target Allocation

### Determine Portfolio-Wide Targets

**Based on your goals, age, risk tolerance:**

**Example (Age 40, Moderate-Aggressive):**

**Target Allocation:**
- 75% Stocks
  - 50% U.S. Stocks
  - 15% International Developed
  - 10% Emerging Markets
- 25% Bonds

**In dollars (on $403,000):**
- U.S. Stocks: $201,500 (50%)
- International: $60,450 (15%)
- Emerging Markets: $40,300 (10%)
- Bonds: $100,750 (25%)

**Compare to actual:**

| Asset Class | Target | Actual | Difference |
|-------------|--------|--------|------------|
| U.S. Stocks | $201,500 (50%) | $279,600 (69.4%) | +$78,100 (overweight!) |
| International | $60,450 (15%) | $17,000 (4.2%) | -$43,450 (underweight!) |
| Emerging Markets | $40,300 (10%) | $25,000 (6.2%) | -$15,300 (underweight!) |
| Bonds | $100,750 (25%) | $45,400 (11.3%) | -$55,350 (underweight!) |

**Actions needed:**
- Sell $78k U.S. stocks
- Buy $43k international stocks
- Buy $15k emerging markets
- Buy $55k bonds

**But WHERE to make these trades?** (See next section)

---

## Step 5: Coordinate Rebalancing Across Accounts

### The Smart Rebalancing Strategy

**Rules:**
1. **Prioritize tax-advantaged accounts** (no tax consequences)
2. **Maintain optimal asset location** (bonds in IRA, stocks in taxable)
3. **Use new contributions first** (before selling)
4. **Minimize trades in taxable accounts** (tax implications)

**Example Rebalancing Plan:**

**Current Status:**
- Need to reduce U.S. stocks by $78k
- Need to add international by $43k
- Need to add EM by $15k
- Need to add bonds by $55k

**Account-by-Account Strategy:**

**John 401(k) ($120,000 - currently all target-date fund):**
- **Action:** Switch from target-date to individual funds
- Sell target-date fund
- Buy: $60k U.S. stocks, $25k bonds, $20k international, $15k EM
- **Why:** 401k = tax-deferred, no taxes on this repositioning

**Jane 401(k) ($90,000 - currently 70/30):**
- **Action:** Reduce U.S. stocks, add bonds
- Sell $18k VTSAX
- Buy $18k VBMFX (bonds)
- **New allocation:** $45k stocks (50%), $45k bonds (50%)
- **Why:** 401k = tax-deferred, no taxes

**Old 401(k) ($45,000 - currently mixed in TDF):**
- **Action:** Roll over to John's Traditional IRA (consolidate accounts!)
- **Why:** Fewer accounts to manage, better fund options

**John Roth IRA ($25,000 - currently all EM):**
- **Action:** Keep as-is (EM appropriate for Roth - high growth potential)
- **Why:** Maximize tax-free growth with highest-growth asset

**IRAs ($30,000 Trad + $45,000 rollover = $75,000 total after rollover):**
- **Action:** Allocate to bonds (tax-inefficient asset)
- Current: $22k stocks, $8k bonds
- New: $0 stocks, $75k bonds
- **Why:** Bonds tax-inefficient, best in IRA

**Taxable Accounts ($85,000 total):**
- **Action:** Maintain tax-efficient stocks
- Sell individual stocks (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA) = $35k
- Buy VTI and VXUS (index funds, more tax-efficient)
- New: $60k VTI, $25k VXUS
- **Why:** Index funds lower tax drag than individual stocks

**HSA ($8,000):**
- **Action:** Keep current allocation (82.5% stocks, 17.5% bonds)
- **Why:** HSA is triple tax-advantaged, invest aggressively

**Final Allocation After Rebalancing:**

| Account | Holdings | Value | Purpose |
|---------|----------|-------|---------|
| John 401(k) | 50% US, 17% Intl, 12% EM, 21% Bonds | $120,000 | Broad diversification |
| Jane 401(k) | 50% US Stocks, 50% Bonds | $90,000 | Balanced |
| John Trad IRA | 100% Bonds | $75,000 | Tax-inefficient bonds shielded |
| John Roth IRA | 100% EM | $25,000 | Highest growth, tax-free |
| Joint Brokerage | 71% VTI, 29% VXUS | $50,000 | Tax-efficient stocks |
| John Brokerage | 71% VTI, 29% VXUS | $35,000 | Tax-efficient stocks |
| John HSA | 82.5% Stocks, 17.5% Bonds | $8,000 | Aggressive (long horizon) |

**Total Portfolio:**
- U.S. Stocks: ~$202k (50%) ✅
- International: ~$60k (15%) ✅
- EM: ~$40k (10%) ✅
- Bonds: ~$101k (25%) ✅

**Perfect 75/25 stocks/bonds with optimal asset location!**

## Step 6: Manage Ongoing Contributions

### The Contribution Strategy

**Monthly contributions across accounts:**

| Account | Monthly Contribution | Annual Contribution |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------|
| John 401(k) | $1,500 (+ $500 match) | $24,000 |
| Jane 401(k) | $1,200 (+ $400 match) | $19,200 |
| John Roth IRA | $583 | $7,000 |
| Joint Brokerage | $1,000 | $12,000 |
| John HSA | $333 | $4,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **$5,016/month** | **$66,200/year** |

**Smart contribution approach:**

**Instead of spreading equally, direct contributions strategically:**

**Goal:** Maintain 75/25 stocks/bonds while respecting asset location

**Quarterly Review:**
1. Calculate current allocation
2. Identify underweight asset classes
3. Direct next 3 months of contributions to underweight areas

**Example:**

**Q1 Check (March):**
- Stocks drifted to 78% (overweight by 3%)
- Bonds at 22% (underweight by 3%)

**Q2 Contribution Plan (April-June):**
- John 401(k): Direct to bonds (increase bond allocation)
- Jane 401(k): Direct to bonds
- Roth IRA: Continue EM (as planned)
- Taxable: Skip new contributions (already overweight stocks)
- HSA: Continue current allocation

**Result:** Drift corrected without selling (tax-free rebalancing!)

---

## Step 7: Simplify and Consolidate

### Account Consolidation Opportunities

**Too many accounts = complexity**

**Consolidation strategies:**

**1. Roll Old 401(k)s to IRA**

**Benefits:**
- Fewer accounts to track
- Better investment options (ETFs vs. limited 401k funds)
- Lower fees (401k fees often 0.5-1%, IRAs can be 0%)

**How:**
- Contact old 401(k) provider
- Request "direct rollover" to IRA (avoids taxes)
- Moves to Traditional IRA (tax treatment unchanged)

**When NOT to roll over:**
- 401(k) has excellent low-cost funds (rare)
- Need to access before 59.5 (401k allows at 55, IRA doesn't)
- Mega backdoor Roth strategy (keep 401k open)

---

**2. Use One Primary Brokerage**

**Instead of:**
- Robinhood for stocks
- Fidelity for 401k
- Schwab for IRA
- Vanguard for Roth

**Consolidate to:**
- Fidelity for everything (401k, IRA, Roth, taxable)
- **Benefit:** One login, one dashboard, easier tracking

**How:**
- Open accounts at chosen brokerage
- Transfer positions ("ACAT transfer") from other brokerages
- Close old accounts

**Best brokerages for consolidation:**
- Fidelity (excellent all-around)
- Schwab (great if you bank with them)
- Vanguard (best for Vanguard fund investors)

---

**3. Combine Spouse IRAs (If Applicable)**

**Can't actually combine**, but can simplify:

**Example:**
- John has Trad IRA at Schwab
- Jane has Trad IRA at Fidelity
- John has Roth IRA at Vanguard
- Jane has Roth IRA at Fidelity

**Simplified:**
- Both Trad IRAs at Fidelity
- Both Roth IRAs at Fidelity
- **Result:** 2 accounts instead of 4 (still separate ownership, but one platform)

---

## Step 8: Track Performance Holistically

### Don't Judge Accounts Individually

**Wrong thinking:**
- "My Roth IRA is up 15%, my 401k is only up 5%"
- "Roth is better!"

**Why it's wrong:**
- Roth holds emerging markets (high growth, high volatility)
- 401k holds bonds (low growth, stability)
- Different purposes! Can't compare.

**Right thinking:**
- **Total portfolio up 8%**
- Each account playing its role
- Roth provides growth, 401k provides stability

---

### Calculate True Portfolio Return

**Formula:**
```
Total Return = (Ending Value - Beginning Value - Contributions) / Beginning Value
```

**Example:**

**Beginning of Year:**
- Total portfolio: $403,000

**End of Year:**
- Total portfolio: $448,000

**Contributions during year:**
- $66,200

**Calculation:**
- Change: $448k - $403k = $45,000
- Less contributions: $45k - $66.2k = -$21,200 (wait, negative?)
- Actually: $448k = $403k + $66.2k (contributions) + return
- Return = $448k - $403k - $66.2k = -$21.2k

Hmm, that's a loss. Let me recalculate:

**Correct Calculation:**
- Ending value: $448,000
- Beginning value: $403,000
- Contributions: $66,200
- Investment gains = $448k - $403k - $66.2k = -$21,200 (loss!)

**Wait, that means:**
- Started with $403k
- Added $66k
- Should have $469k
- Only have $448k
- Lost $21k = -4.4% return

**OR if it was a gain:**
- Ending value: $490,000 (example)
- Beginning value: $403,000
- Contributions: $66,200
- Gains = $490k - $403k - $66.2k = $20,800
- Return = $20,800 / $403,000 = 5.2%

**Use portfolio tracking tools to automate this:**
- Personal Capital (free)
- Empower (free)
- Kubera (paid)
- Spreadsheet (manual but flexible)

### Using Sage for Multi-Account Management

**Portfolio-Wide Rebalancing Plan:**

```
Hey Sage, help me rebalance across my multiple accounts:

MY ACCOUNTS:
1. 401(k) at Fidelity: $120,000 (currently: 100% target-date 2055)
2. Roth IRA at Schwab: $25,000 (currently: 100% VWO)
3. Trad IRA at Schwab: $30,000 (currently: 73% VTI, 27% BND)
4. Taxable at Robinhood: $50,000 (currently: 60% VTI, 40% VXUS)

TOTAL: $225,000

MY TARGET ALLOCATION:
- 70% Stocks (U.S. 50%, International 15%, EM 5%)
- 30% Bonds

CONSTRAINTS:
- Want to maintain tax-efficient asset location
- Prefer not to sell in taxable (avoid taxes)
- Can trade freely in IRAs/401k

Can you recommend:
1. What should I hold in each account to hit targets?
2. Specific trades to make in each account
3. Dollar amounts for each holding
4. Any tax implications I should be aware of
```

**Contribution Coordination:**

```
Hey Sage, I'm contributing $4,000/month across multiple accounts:

MONTHLY CONTRIBUTIONS:
- 401(k): $1,500
- Roth IRA: $583
- Taxable: $1,500
- HSA: $417

CURRENT ALLOCATION:
- 78% stocks (target: 75%)
- 22% bonds (target: 25%)

How should I direct my contributions over the next 3 months to rebalance back to 75/25 without selling anything?

Which accounts should get stocks vs. bonds to optimize?
```

## Common Multi-Account Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Rebalancing Each Account Independently

**The Trap:**
- Rebalance 401k to 60/40
- Rebalance IRA to 60/40
- Rebalance taxable to 60/40

**Why it's wrong:**
- Ignores asset location optimization
- Forces tax-inefficient assets into taxable
- Miss opportunities to concentrate assets

**The Fix:**
- View all accounts as ONE portfolio
- Rebalance to target OVERALL
- Maintain asset location (bonds in IRA, stocks in taxable)
- Might mean 80/20 in one account, 40/60 in another (averages to 60/40)

---

### Mistake #2: Forgetting About Old 401(k)s

**The Trap:**
- Leave old 401(k)s forgotten at previous employers
- Don't track them
- They drift out of alignment

**Why it's wrong:**
- Old 401(k)s often have high fees (0.5-1%+)
- Limited investment options
- No longer contributing, so no reason to keep there

**The Fix:**
- Roll over to IRA (better options, lower fees)
- Or roll into current employer 401(k) (if allowed)
- Consolidate and actively manage

**Tax savings:** $500+/year on $100k (from fee reduction alone)

---

### Mistake #3: Duplicating Holdings Across Accounts

**The Trap:**
- 401(k): Holds VTI (total market)
- IRA: Holds VTI
- Taxable: Holds VTI
- Roth: Holds VTI

**Why it's wrong:**
- You're 100% in one fund! (Zero diversification)
- Each account should have different purpose
- Missing asset location benefits

**The Fix:**
- Differentiate holdings by account:
  - 401(k): Bonds (tax-inefficient)
  - IRA: Bonds + REITs
  - Roth: EM/Small-cap (growth)
  - Taxable: VTI + VXUS (tax-efficient)

---

### Mistake #4: Not Communicating with Spouse

**The Trap:**
- You manage your accounts your way
- Spouse manages theirs differently
- No coordination

**Result:**
- Household allocation is unknown
- Potential over-concentration
- Inefficient asset location

**The Fix:**
- Quarterly portfolio review TOGETHER
- Treat all accounts as one household portfolio
- Coordinate contributions and rebalancing
- One person tracks everything (or use shared spreadsheet)

---
