## Step 3: Risk Assessment (10 min)

### Portfolio Risk Metrics

**Ask Sage:**

```
Analyze my portfolio risk. What's my beta,
volatility, and maximum drawdown potential?
```

**Sage's Risk Analysis:**

```
⚠️ Portfolio Risk Assessment

Risk Metrics:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Portfolio Beta: 1.42
- 42% more volatile than market
- If SPY drops 10%, you drop ~14.2%
- High risk, high reward profile

Volatility (Std Dev):
- Daily: 1.8%
- Monthly: 8.2%
- Annualized: 28.4% (High!)

For context:
- SPY volatility: ~18%
- You're 58% more volatile than market

Correlation to Market:
- SPY: 0.92 (very high)
- QQQ: 0.95 (extremely high)
- Move with tech/market heavily

Sector Concentration Risk:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🚨 CRITICAL RISK ALERT:
75.6% in one sector (Technology)

Historical Sector Crashes:
- Tech Bubble (2000-2002): -78%
- Financial Crisis (2007-2009): -89% (Financials)
- COVID Crash (2020): -34% (Travel/Leisure)

If tech corrects 30%:
Your portfolio: -23% (75.6% × 30%)

This is your BIGGEST RISK.

Correlation Matrix:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

All tech stocks move together:
AAPL-NVDA: 0.75
AAPL-MSFT: 0.82
NVDA-AMD: 0.92 (almost identical!)

Not truly diversified.
All drop when tech drops.

Maximum Drawdown Potential:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Stress Test Scenarios:

Mild Correction (-10% SPY):
Your Portfolio: -14.2% ($7,400 loss)

Moderate Correction (-20% SPY):
Your Portfolio: -28.4% ($14,800 loss)

Bear Market (-30% SPY):
Your Portfolio: -42.6% ($22,300 loss)

Severe Crisis (-40% SPY):
Your Portfolio: -56.8% ($29,800 loss)

Can you handle these losses?
- Emotionally?
- Financially?
- Without panic selling?

If NO to any: Reduce risk now.

Value at Risk (VaR):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

95% confidence:
- Worst monthly loss: -12%
- Worst quarterly loss: -24%
- Worst annual loss: -35%

There's a 5% chance you lose more than this.

Risk-Adjusted Return:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Sharpe Ratio: 0.95
- Decent but not great
- Taking a lot of risk for the return

Compare:
- 60/40 portfolio: Sharpe 1.2
- You: Sharpe 0.95

You're taking MORE risk for WORSE
risk-adjusted returns.

Recommendations:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. REDUCE TECH to 50% (Critical!)
   - Lowers beta to ~1.15
   - Reduces max drawdown to -35%
   - Improves sleep quality

2. ADD BONDS (15% target)
   - Negative correlation to stocks
   - Cushion in crashes
   - Reduces volatility

3. ADD UNCORRELATED ASSETS
   - International (VEA)
   - REITs
   - Commodities (GLD)
   - Alternatives

4. POSITION SIZE LIMITS
   - Max 20% per stock
   - Max 40% per sector
   - Enforce discipline

Risk Rating: D
Too concentrated, too volatile.
Immediate rebalancing needed.
```

***

## Step 4: Holdings Analysis (15 min)

### Review Each Position

**For every holding, ask:**

**Is the thesis still intact?**

**Example: AAPL Review**

```
Ask Sage:
"Review my AAPL position. Should I hold,
trim, or sell?"
```

**Sage's Position Review:**

```
AAPL Position Analysis - Monthly Review

Your Position:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Entry: $171.50 (4 months ago)
Current: $176.80
Shares: 86
Value: $15,205
Weight: 29% of portfolio
P/L: +$456 (+3.1%)

Original Thesis (4 months ago):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ iPhone 15 cycle strength
✓ Services revenue growth
✓ Valuation reasonable (P/E 28)
✓ Buybacks continuing
✓ Dividend aristocrat

Thesis Check (Now):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ iPhone demand: STILL STRONG
- iPhone 15 sales beat expectations
- China sales recovering
- Thesis intact ✓

✅ Services: ACCELERATING
- Revenue up 16% YoY
- Margins expanding
- Better than expected ✓

⚠️ Valuation: SLIGHTLY ELEVATED
- P/E now 30 (vs 28 at entry)
- Still reasonable but premium
- Thesis slightly weakened

✅ Buybacks: CONTINUING
- $90B annual pace
- EPS benefiting
- Thesis intact ✓

New Developments:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Positive:
✓ Vision Pro launched (new category)
✓ AI features announced (iOS 18)
✓ India production scaling

Negative:
⚠️ DOJ antitrust lawsuit
⚠️ EU regulations (App Store)
⚠️ Mature smartphone market

Overall Thesis: INTACT ✓
Company fundamentals strong.

However:
⚠️ Position size TOO LARGE (29%)

Recommendation:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Action: TRIM (not sell)
- Reduce from 29% → 20%
- Sell ~31 shares (~$5,480)
- Keep 55 shares (~$9,724)

Why:
- Company quality: Still A+
- Thesis: Still valid
- But: Too concentrated

When:
- Next time AAPL up 2-3%
- Use limit order at $180
- Don't wait for "perfect" price

Use proceeds:
- $3,000 → VOO (diversify)
- $2,000 → BND (bonds)
- $480 → Cash

Keep the position:
✅ AAPL is quality
✅ Long-term compounder
✅ Just right-size it
❌ Don't sell entirely

Thesis: HOLD (after trimming)
```

### Red Flags to Watch

**Sell signals:**

```
🚩 Thesis Broken:
- Original reason for buying no longer valid
- Company fundamentals deteriorating
- Competitive position weakening
- Management issues

🚩 Better Opportunity:
- Found much better investment
- Opportunity cost too high
- Capital better deployed elsewhere

🚩 Risk Management:
- Position too large (>20%)
- Sector too concentrated
- Volatility too high for comfort
- Need to derisk portfolio

🚩 Price Action:
- Broke key support levels
- Downtrend established
- Negative divergences
- Technical breakdown

🚩 Valuation:
- Became extremely overvalued
- Bubble territory
- Disconnect from fundamentals
- Better to trim and take gains

Example: TSLA Position
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Red Flag Check:
⚠️ Down -5.2% this month
⚠️ Competition intensifying
⚠️ Margin compression concerns
⚠️ CEO distracted (X, politics)

Action: Monitor closely
Consider exit if breaks $230 support
```

## Step 6: Journal Entry (5 min)

### Document Your Review

**Monthly Review Journal Template:**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
MONTHLY REVIEW - November 2024
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Performance Summary:
- Month: +4.9%
- YTD: +18.5%
- vs SPY: +1.7% outperformance ✓

Top Insights:
1. Tech concentration at critical level (75.6%)
2. NVDA and AAPL positions too large
3. No bond allocation = too much risk
4. Need to rebalance urgently

Best Decision This Month:
- Stayed disciplined, didn't chase momentum
- Let winners run (NVDA +12.5%)

Worst Decision This Month:
- Didn't trim NVDA earlier when flagged last month
- Procrastinated on rebalancing

What I Learned:
- Letting winners run is good, but watch position size
- Monthly reviews catch problems before they're huge
- Rebalancing is not optional—it's risk management

Goals for Next Month:
1. Execute rebalancing plan (trim AAPL, NVDA)
2. Add diversification (VOO, BND)
3. Get portfolio risk back to normal
4. Sleep better at night

Emotional Check:
- Feeling: Anxious about concentration
- Confidence: 7/10 (high but aware of risks)
- Discipline: 8/10 (following plan)

Action Items:
✅ Week 1: Trim AAPL
✅ Week 2: Trim NVDA, add VOO
✅ Week 3: Add BND
⏸️ Week 4: Monitor and adjust

Next Review: December 7, 2024

## Quarterly vs Monthly Reviews

### Monthly Review (45-60 min)

**Focus on:**

* Performance tracking

* Note lessons
* Continuous improvement

**3. Ignoring Allocation Drift**

* "It's only 5% over"
* "I'll rebalance later"
* Letting winners run too much
* Concentration creep

**Better:**

* Set drift thresholds (5-10%)
* Rebalance systematically
* Trim winners
* Maintain discipline

**4. Emotional Decisions**

* Panic selling losers
* Chasing winners
* FOMO additions
* Revenge trading

**Better:**

* Follow the process
* Data-driven decisions
* Stick to the plan
* Remove emotion

**5. Paralysis by Analysis**

* Over-analyzing

## Advanced Review Techniques

### Attribution Analysis

**Ask Sage:**

```
What drove my performance this month?
Break down returns by position and sector.
```

**Attribution Report:**

```
Performance Attribution - November

Total Return: +4.9% ($2,450)

By Position:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
NVDA: +2.4% contribution ($1,200)
AAPL: +1.2% contribution ($600)
MSFT: +0.9% contribution ($450)
VOO: +0.3% contribution ($150)
AMD: +0.3% contribution ($150)
TSLA: -0.2% contribution (-$100)

Top Driver: NVDA (49% of total return)
Drag: TSLA (offset gains)

By Sector:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Technology: +4.5% ($2,250)
Broad Market: +0.3% ($150)
Consumer: -0.2% ($-100)

If tech was flat:
Your return would've been: +0.4%

Insight: Extremely dependent on tech.
Diversification would smooth returns.
```

### Tax Impact Tracking

**Ask Sage:**

```
What's my tax impact from potential
rebalancing trades?
```

**Tax Projection:**

```
Tax Impact Analysis - Proposed Trades

Proposed Rebalancing:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SELL:
- AAPL: 31 shares at $180
  Cost basis: $171.50
  Gain: $263.50
  Tax (24%): $63.24 (short-term)

- NVDA: 8 shares at $735
  Cost basis: $585
  Gain: $1,200
  Tax (15%): $180 (long-term)

Total Tax Impact: $243.24
Net Proceeds After Tax: $11,217

BUY:
- VOO: $5,000 (no tax)
- BND: $6,000 (no tax)

Net Capital Deployed: $11,000
Remaining Cash: $217

Tax Optimization:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚠️ AAPL short-term gain (24% tax)
Better: Hold 1 more month → long-term (15%)
Savings: $47

✅ NVDA long-term already (15% tax)
Can sell now without penalty

Alternative Strategy:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- Trim NVDA now (long-term)
- Wait 1 month on AAPL (convert to long-term)
- Save $47 in taxes

Or:
- Harvest TSLA loss (-$270) to offset gains
- Reduces tax impact to near $0
```
