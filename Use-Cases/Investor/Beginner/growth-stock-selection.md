## What is Growth Investing?

### The Philosophy

**Growth investing** is buying stocks of companies that are growing revenues, earnings, and market share significantly faster than the overall market.

**The Core Principle:**

> "Pay a fair price for exceptional growth. The compounding will reward you handsomely."

Unlike value investors who seek discounts, growth investors pay **premium prices** for companies with:

* Exceptional growth rates (20-50%+ annually)
* Large addressable markets (TAM)
* Disruptive products or business models
* Strong competitive advantages (moats)
* Long runways for expansion

**The Bet:** If a company's earnings grow 30%/year for 10 years, a "high" P/E of 40 today will look cheap in retrospect.

### Historical Performance

**Why Growth Investing Works:**

* From 1927-2020, growth stocks outperformed value by \~30% in bull markets
* Top tech companies (FAANG): 300-1,000%+ returns over decade
* Amazon (1997-2023): +180,000% (turned $10k into $18 million)
* Apple (2003-2023): +55,000% (turned $10k into $5.5 million)
* Netflix (2002-2021): +41,000% (turned $10k into $4.1 million)

**The Catch:**

* High volatility (50-80% drawdowns during bear markets)
* Many growth stocks fail (Pets.com, WeWork, etc.)
* Requires stomach for wild swings
* Can underperform for years during value cycles

**Famous Growth Investors:**

* **Peter Lynch** - Fidelity Magellan Fund, 29% annual returns for 13 years
* **Cathie Wood** - ARK Invest, focused on disruptive innovation
* **Philip Fisher** - Pioneered growth investing, influenced Warren Buffett
* **Thomas Rowe Price Jr.** - Founded T. Rowe Price, focused on growth stocks

### Growth vs. Value Investing

| Aspect           | Growth Investing                         | Value Investing                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Focus**        | Fast-growing companies                   | Undervalued, established companies    |
| **Valuation**    | Willing to pay high P/E (30-100+)        | Seek low P/E (<15)                    |
| **Timeframe**    | 3-10 years (let growth compound)         | 2-5 years (wait for revaluation)      |
| **Risk**         | High volatility, potential to overpay    | Value traps, slow/no appreciation     |
| **Best Markets** | Bull markets, low interest rates         | Bear markets, high interest rates     |
| **Dividends**    | Rare (growth companies reinvest profits) | Common (mature companies pay out)     |
| **Examples**     | Tech, biotech, EVs, AI                   | Banks, energy, industrials, utilities |

**Both can work** - this workflow focuses on growth.

## Key Growth Investing Metrics

### Metric #1: Revenue Growth Rate

**Formula:**

```
Revenue Growth = ((Current Year Revenue - Prior Year Revenue) / Prior Year Revenue) × 100
```

**What to look for:**

* **20%+ annually:** Solid growth
* **30-50%+ annually:** Exceptional growth
* **100%+ annually:** Hyper-growth (often early-stage)

**Example:**

* 2023 Revenue: $500 million
* 2024 Revenue: $700 million
* Growth = (($700M - $500M) / $500M) × 100 = 40%

**Why it matters:**

* Revenue growth is harder to manipulate than earnings
* Shows real customer demand for products/services
* Leading indicator of future profitability

**Important:** Look for **consistent** growth (not one-time spike).

**Using Maverick to Find High-Growth Revenue:**

```
Hey Maverick, I'm looking for high-growth opportunities with strong revenue momentum.

Can you screen for:
- Revenue growth: 30%+ annually (last 3 years)
- Revenue: over $100 million (not too early-stage)
- Market cap: $500M - $50B (mid-cap sweet spot)
- Sector: Tech, Healthcare, Consumer Discretionary, or Clean Energy

Give me 10-15 stocks with brief explanations of their growth drivers.
```

### Metric #2: Earnings Growth Rate

**Formula:**

```
Earnings Growth = ((Current Year EPS - Prior Year EPS) / Prior Year EPS) × 100
```

**What to look for:**

* **15%+ annually:** Good growth
* **25%+ annually:** Excellent growth
* **50%+ annually:** Exceptional (may not be sustainable)

**Example:**

* 2023 EPS: $2.00
* 2024 EPS: $2.80
* Growth = (($2.80 - $2.00) / $2.00) × 100 = 40%

**Why it matters:**

* Shows the company is not just growing revenue, but converting it to profit
* Indicates improving efficiency and operating leverage
* Directly drives stock price appreciation

**Note:** Early-stage growth companies may not be profitable yet. That's OK if revenue growth is strong and path to profitability is clear.

### Metric #3: PEG Ratio (Price/Earnings-to-Growth)

**Formula:**

```
PEG Ratio = P/E Ratio / Earnings Growth Rate
```

**What it means:** Whether you're paying a fair price for the growth you're getting.

**Example:**

* Stock has P/E of 40
* Earnings growing at 50%/year
* PEG = 40 / 50 = 0.8

**Interpretation:**

* **PEG < 1.0:** Undervalued relative to growth (good buy)
* **PEG = 1.0:** Fairly valued
* **PEG 1.0-2.0:** Slight premium (acceptable for quality growth)
* **PEG > 2.0:** Overvalued (paying too much for growth)

**Peter Lynch's Rule:**

> "A fairly priced growth stock should have a PEG ratio of 1.0. Under 1.0 is cheap, over 2.0 is expensive."

**Example Comparison:**

**Stock A:**

* P/E: 60, Growth: 30%, PEG: 2.0 → Expensive

**Stock B:**

* P/E: 35, Growth: 40%, PEG: 0.875 → Good value for growth!

**Stock C:**

* P/E: 25, Growth: 50%, PEG: 0.5 → Exceptional value!

**Ask Money Monty:**

```
Hey Money Monty, what's the PEG ratio for [TICKER]?

Calculate:
1. Current P/E ratio
2. Expected earnings growth rate (next 3-5 years)
3. PEG ratio
4. Is this stock fairly valued, undervalued, or overvalued for a growth stock?
```

### Metric #4: Total Addressable Market (TAM)

**What it means:** The total market opportunity if the company captured 100% market share.

**Why it matters:**

* A company with $1B revenue in a $5B market has limited upside (already 20% share)
* A company with $1B revenue in a $500B market has huge runway (only 0.2% share)

**Example:**

* **Stripe** (payments): TAM \~$2 trillion (global payments market)
* **Airbnb** (lodging): TAM \~$1.8 trillion (global travel/hospitality)
* **Shopify** (e-commerce): TAM \~$5 trillion (global e-commerce)

**What to look for:**

* TAM should be at least 10× current revenue (room to grow)
* Ideally 50-100× current revenue (massive runway)
* Growing TAM is even better (market itself expanding)

**Example:**

* Company has $500M revenue
* TAM is $50 billion
* Currently 1% market share
* If they reach 10% share (realistic for category leader) → $5B revenue (10× growth)

**Ask Maverick:**

```
Hey Maverick, what's the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for [TICKER]'s business?

Can you estimate:
1. The total market size (TAM) for their product/service
2. Their current market share (%)
3. How fast is the overall market growing?
4. What market share could they realistically capture in 5-10 years?
5. What would their revenue be at that market share?

I want to understand the growth runway.
```

### Metric #5: Rule of 40

**Formula:**

```
Rule of 40 = Revenue Growth Rate (%) + Profit Margin (%)
```

**What it means:** A simple test for sustainable growth in software/SaaS companies.

**Rule:**

* **≥ 40:** Excellent (healthy balance of growth and profitability)
* **30-40:** Good (acceptable)
* **< 30:** Poor (either too slow growth or too unprofitable)

**Example 1 (High Growth, Low Profit):**

* Revenue growth: 50%
* Profit margin: -5% (losing money)
* Rule of 40: 50 + (-5) = 45 ✅ (Acceptable, growth justifies losses)

**Example 2 (Moderate Growth, High Profit):**

* Revenue growth: 15%
* Profit margin: 30%
* Rule of 40: 15 + 30 = 45 ✅ (Acceptable, profitable and growing)

**Example 3 (Slow Growth, Unprofitable):**

* Revenue growth: 10%
* Profit margin: -15%
* Rule of 40: 10 + (-15) = -5 ❌ (Red flag! Slow growth AND losing money)

**Best used for:** SaaS, cloud software, subscription businesses

**Ask Money Monty:**

```
Hey Money Monty, can you calculate the "Rule of 40" for [TICKER]?

1. What's the revenue growth rate (last 12 months)?
2. What's the profit margin (or EBITDA margin)?
3. What's the Rule of 40 score?
4. For a SaaS/software company, is this healthy?
```

### Metric #6: Customer/User Growth

**What to track:**

* Number of active users (for consumer apps)
* Number of paying customers (for B2B)
* Customer retention rate (% of customers who stay)
* Net Dollar Retention (revenue from existing customers over time)

**Example:**

* **Spotify:** 220M users (2020) → 615M users (2024) = 180% growth
* **Shopify:** 1M merchants (2019) → 4.4M merchants (2024) = 340% growth

**Why it matters:**

* Revenue growth often follows user growth
* High user growth = product-market fit
* Shows momentum and adoption

**What to look for:**

* **User/customer growth ≥ revenue growth:** Healthy (monetization may improve later)
* **User growth < revenue growth:** Mixed (growing revenue per user, but slowing adoption)
* **Accelerating user growth:** Exceptional (hitting inflection point)

**Ask Maverick:**

```
Hey Maverick, what's [TICKER]'s user/customer growth trend?

Can you find:
1. Total users/customers (current and 2-3 years ago)
2. Growth rate per year
3. Customer retention/churn rate (if available)
4. Net Dollar Retention (for SaaS companies)

Is the user base growing, stable, or shrinking?
```

* Crypto exchanges (Coinbase)
* Neobanks (SoFi, Chime)

**Using Maverick to Find Emerging Themes:**

```
Hey Maverick, what are the hottest growth themes RIGHT NOW in the market?

Can you identify:
1. 5-7 major growth themes or trends (AI, clean energy, etc.)
2. Why each theme has strong tailwinds
3. 2-3 leading stocks in each theme
4. Which themes are early-stage vs. mature

I want to find emerging growth opportunities before they're mainstream.
```

### Step 2: Screen for Growth Candidates

**Using Maverick for Growth Screening:**

```
Hey Maverick, I'm building a growth portfolio. Please screen for stocks with:

GROWTH CRITERIA:
- Revenue growth: 25%+ annually (last 3 years)
- Earnings growth: 20%+ annually (or path to profitability if not yet profitable)
- Market cap: $2B - $100B (avoid micro-cap and mega-cap)
- Trading volume: Above average (liquid)

QUALITY FILTERS:
- Gross margins: 50%+ (shows pricing power)
- Debt-to-equity: <1.5 (manageable debt)
- Insider ownership: >10% (management has skin in the game)

SECTORS:
- Tech, Healthcare, Consumer Discretionary, Clean Energy, Fintech

Can you suggest 15-20 stocks that meet these criteria with explanations?
```

**Alternative: Thematic Growth Screen:**

```
Hey Maverick, I'm interested in [SPECIFIC THEME: AI / Cloud / EVs / Fintech / Biotech].

Can you find 8-10 stocks that:
1. Are pure plays on this theme (core business, not side project)
2. Have revenue growth of 30%+ annually
3. Are gaining market share
4. Have strong competitive positions
5. Market cap between $1B and $50B

Explain why each is well-positioned for this theme.
```

### Step 3: Deep Dive on Top Candidates

From the screening, pick 5-7 stocks for deeper analysis.

**Questions to Ask Money Monty:**

```
Hey Money Monty, I'm considering [TICKER] as a growth investment. Please analyze:

1. GROWTH METRICS:
   - Revenue growth: Last 3 years and projected next 3 years
   - Earnings growth: Last 3 years and projected next 3 years
   - User/customer growth (if applicable)
   - Market share trends (gaining or losing?)

2. PROFITABILITY PATH:
   - Is the company profitable? If not, when is it expected to be?
   - Gross margins, operating margins, net margins
   - Trend: Improving or deteriorating?

3. BUSINESS QUALITY:
   - What's their competitive advantage (moat)?
   - Who are the main competitors?
   - What makes this company special?

4. FINANCIAL HEALTH:
   - Cash position and burn rate (if unprofitable)
   - Debt levels (manageable?)
   - Cash flow: Positive or negative?

5. VALUATION:
   - P/E ratio (if profitable) or P/S ratio (if not)
   - PEG ratio
   - How does valuation compare to peers?

6. RISKS:
   - What could derail the growth story?
   - Competitive threats?
   - Regulatory risks?
   - Execution risks?

7. OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
   - Buy, hold, or avoid?
   - If buy: What's the upside/downside scenario (next 3-5 years)?
   - Position size recommendation (% of portfolio)
```

### Step 4: Evaluate the Growth Narrative

**The Story Should Make Sense:**

Every great growth stock has a compelling narrative:

* **Amazon (2000s):** "E-commerce will replace physical retail"
* **Netflix (2010s):** "Streaming will replace cable TV"
* **Tesla (2010s-2020s):** "EVs will replace gas cars"
* **NVIDIA (2020s):** "AI will transform every industry"

**Ask yourself:**

1. **Is the trend real and sustainable?** (Not just hype)
2. **Is the TAM large enough?** (Can support 10× growth)
3. **Does this company have a sustainable advantage?** (Or will competition crush margins?)
4. **Can they execute?** (Strong management, proven track record)
5. **What's the bear case?** (Why might this fail?)

**Using Maverick to Validate the Narrative:**

```
Hey Maverick, I'm excited about [TICKER]'s growth story:

[Describe the narrative in 2-3 sentences]

Can you help me validate this thesis?
1. What evidence supports this growth narrative?
2. What are the key risks or counterarguments?
3. How dependent is this on a single trend/technology/customer?
4. What would prove this thesis wrong in the next 12 months?

I want to make sure I'm not falling for hype.
```

### Step 5: Check Valuation (Avoid Overpaying)

**Growth stocks can be expensive, but there are limits.**

**Red Flags (Overvaluation):**

* ❌ P/E over 100 (unless hyper-growth like 100%+ revenue growth)
* ❌ P/S over 20 (paying 20× annual sales)
* ❌ PEG over 3.0 (paying 3× too much for growth)
* ❌ Market cap bigger than realistic revenue potential (in 10 years)
* ❌ Stock up 500%+ in 12 months with no fundamental change

**Example of Overvaluation (2021 Bubble):**

* Rivian IPO: $100B market cap, $0 revenue
* Snowflake: P/S of 100+ (paying 100× sales)
* Many SPACs: Trading at 10-20× projected revenue (years away)

**Result:** Most crashed 70-90% in 2022.

**Green Flags (Fair Valuation for Growth):**

* ✅ PEG under 2.0
* ✅ P/S under 15 (for high-growth SaaS)
* ✅ P/E under 50 (for profitable growth companies)
* ✅ Reasonable path to 3-5× revenue in 5-10 years
* ✅ Market cap is < 20% of TAM

**Ask Money Monty:**

```
Hey Money Monty, I'm concerned about overpaying for [TICKER]. Can you check:

1. What's the current P/E (or P/S if unprofitable)?
2. What's the PEG ratio?
3. How does valuation compare to peers?
4. How does valuation compare to its own historical average?
5. What would be a fair price to pay for this growth?
6. At current price, what's the risk/reward (upside vs. downside)?

Be brutally honest - am I overpaying?
```

### Step 6: Assess Management Quality

**Great growth companies need great leaders.**

**What to look for:**

✅ **Founder-led companies:**

* Founders often have longer-term vision
* More willing to sacrifice short-term profits for long-term growth
* Examples: Bezos (Amazon), Musk (Tesla), Zuckerberg (Meta), Huang (NVIDIA)

✅ **Insider ownership:**

* Management owns significant stock (>5% of company)
* Aligned incentives (they win when shareholders win)
* Less likely to make short-sighted decisions

✅ **Track record of execution:**

* Consistently hit or beat guidance
* Successfully launched new products
* Scaled the business effectively

✅ **Capital allocation skills:**

* Smart acquisitions (not overpaying)
* Investing in R\&D and growth
* Not wasting money on stock buybacks when stock is overvalued

**Red Flags:**

❌ **High executive turnover:**

* CEO or CFO changes multiple times in 3 years
* Signals internal problems

❌ **Insider selling:**

* Executives selling large portions of stock (>50%)
* May indicate they think stock is overvalued

❌ **Overpromising, underdelivering:**

* Consistently miss guidance
* Announce big initiatives that never materialize
* Lost credibility with investors

**Ask Maverick:**

```
Hey Maverick, can you evaluate [TICKER]'s management team?

1. Who is the CEO and what's their background?
2. Is this a founder-led company?
3. How much stock does management own?
4. What's their track record (hitting targets, executing strategy)?
5. Any recent insider buying or selling?
6. Overall, is this a management team I can trust to execute on growth?
```

## Building a Growth Portfolio

### Portfolio Construction Principles

**1. Diversification Across Growth Stages:**

**Mature Growth (40% of portfolio):**

* Large-cap companies (>$50B)
* Consistent 15-25% growth
* Profitable with strong cash flow
* Lower risk, lower upside
* Examples: Microsoft, Apple, Adobe, Visa

**Mid-Stage Growth (40% of portfolio):**

* Mid-cap companies ($5B-$50B)
* 25-50% growth
* Approaching profitability or recently profitable
* Moderate risk, moderate upside
* Examples: CrowdStrike, Datadog, Shopify, DraftKings

**Early-Stage Growth (20% of portfolio):**

* Small-cap companies ($1B-$5B)
* 50-100%+ growth
* Often unprofitable (investing for growth)
* High risk, high upside
* Examples: Depends on market (emerging companies)

**Why this allocation?**

* 40% mature = stability and steady growth
* 40% mid-stage = sweet spot (growth + manageable risk)
* 20% early-stage = moonshot potential (but limited downside)

**2. Sector Diversification:**

Don't put all your growth bets in one sector.

**Example Allocation:**

* 35% Technology (cloud, software, semiconductors)
* 25% Healthcare/Biotech (drugs, devices, health tech)
* 20% Consumer Discretionary (e-commerce, streaming, EVs)
* 10% Financials (fintech, payments)
* 10% Clean Energy / Other Themes

**Why?** If one sector crashes (like tech in 2022), you're not wiped out.

**3. Position Sizing:**

**Conservative:**

* 10-15 stocks
* Each position: 5-10% of portfolio
* Max position: 10%

**Moderate:**

* 15-20 stocks
* Each position: 4-7% of portfolio
* Max position: 10%

**Aggressive (concentrated):**

* 8-12 stocks
* Each position: 7-12% of portfolio
* Max position: 15%

**Rule:** Never let a single stock exceed 20% of your portfolio (even if it grows to that size, trim and rebalance).

### Sample Growth Portfolio ($10,000)

**Strategy:** Balanced growth with diversification

**Mature Growth (40% = $4,000):**

* 10% Microsoft (MSFT) - Cloud + AI = $1,000
* 10% Apple (AAPL) - Services growth + ecosystem = $1,000
* 10% Visa (V) - Digital payments = $1,000
* 10% Alphabet (GOOGL) - Search + Cloud + AI = $1,000

**Mid-Stage Growth (40% = $4,000):**

* 10% CrowdStrike (CRWD) - Cybersecurity = $1,000
* 10% Shopify (SHOP) - E-commerce platform = $1,000
* 10% DraftKings (DKNG) - Sports betting = $1,000
* 10% Datadog (DDOG) - Cloud monitoring = $1,000

**Early-Stage Growth (20% = $2,000):**

* 7% SoFi (SOFI) - Fintech = $700
* 7% Rivian (RIVN) - EV maker = $700
* 6% \[Your pick: emerging AI/biotech/clean energy company] = $600

**Portfolio Characteristics:**

* Blended revenue growth: \~25-30% (weighted average)
* Mix of profitable and unprofitable (investing for growth)
* Diversified across sectors
* Mix of established (MSFT, AAPL) and emerging (SOFI, RIVN)

**Expected Performance:**

* Bull market: 25-40% annual returns
* Bear market: -30% to -50% drawdowns
* Long-term (10 years): 15-20% annualized (if you can stomach volatility)

### Alternative: Growth ETF Portfolio

**For hands-off growth exposure:**

**Allocation:**

* 50% QQQ (Invesco QQQ ETF) - Nasdaq-100, tech-heavy growth
* 30% ARKK (ARK Innovation ETF) - Disruptive innovation
* 20% VONG (Vanguard Russell 1000 Growth) - Broad growth

**Pros:**

* Instant diversification (100+ stocks)
* Professional management (especially ARKK)
* Lower single-stock risk
* Easy to manage

**Cons:**

* Can't outperform (just match the growth indices)
* Higher fees for ARKK (0.75% vs. 0.20% for QQQ)
* Less control over holdings

**Best for:** Investors who want growth exposure but don't want to pick individual stocks.

***

## Managing Growth Stock Volatility

### Expect Wild Swings

**Growth stocks are VOLATILE.**

**Historical Drawdowns (Peak to Trough):**

* **Netflix (2011):** -80% (over 12 months)
* **Tesla (2019):** -60%
* **NVIDIA (2018):** -50%
* **Amazon (2000-2002):** -95%
* **Entire Nasdaq (2000-2002):** -78%
* **Entire Nasdaq (2022):** -33%

**All of these recovered and went on to new highs** (eventually).

**The Reality:**

* 20-30% pullbacks are NORMAL in growth stocks
* 40-50% pullbacks happen every few years
* 60-80% crashes happen during major bear markets

**You MUST be able to stomach this to invest in growth.**

### How to Stay Calm During Volatility

**1. Don't Check Prices Daily:**

* Growth stocks swing 5-10% per day on no news
* Daily checking = emotional roller coaster
* Check weekly or monthly instead

**2. Focus on Fundamentals, Not Price:**

* Is revenue still growing?
* Is the user base still expanding?
* Is the long-term thesis intact?

**If YES:** Price drops are noise (or buying opportunities) **If NO:** Thesis broken, consider exiting

**3. Use Volatility to Your Advantage (Buy the Dip):**

**Strategy:** Keep 10-20% cash to deploy during crashes

**Example:**

* You own $9,000 in growth stocks + $1,000 cash
* Market crashes 30%
* Your $9,000 portfolio → $6,300
* Deploy $1,000 cash at 30% discount
* Total: $7,300 (vs. $7,000 if fully invested)

**Bonus:** When it recovers, you bought more shares cheap.

**4. Set Stop-Losses for Disaster Scenarios:**

**Conservative approach:**

* Set stop-loss at 40-50% below purchase price
* If stock drops that much, fundamentals likely broken
* Exit and redeploy to better opportunity

**Example:**

* Buy at $100
* Stop-loss at $50
* If it hits $50, auto-sell
* Prevents 90% wipeouts (like Pets.com, WeWork, etc.)

**Note:** Only use for your highest-risk positions (early-stage growth). Don't use for mature growth stocks (they can recover).

**5. Rebalance After Big Moves:**

**Scenario:**

* Start with $1,000 each in 10 stocks
* One stock (Stock A) 5× in 2 years → now $5,000
* Other 9 stocks flat → still $9,000 total
* Total portfolio: $14,000
* Stock A is now 35% of portfolio (risk!)

**Action:**

* Trim Stock A from $5,000 to $1,500 (sell $3,500)
* Reallocate $3,500 to other positions or new opportunities
* Lock in gains, reduce concentration risk

**Rule:** If any stock grows to >20% of portfolio, trim to 10-15%.

***

## Growth Investing Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Chasing Hype (FOMO)

**The Trap:**

* Stock is up 300% in 6 months
* Everyone talking about it (Reddit, Twitter, CNBC)
* You buy at the top out of FOMO
* Stock crashes 70% in next 6 months

**Real Examples:**

* GameStop (2021): $500 → $40 (-92%)
* Zoom (2020): $588 → $70 (-88%)
* Peloton (2020): $162 → $8 (-95%)

**The Fix:**

* Never buy a stock just because it's "hot"
* Wait for pullbacks (20-30% dips) to establish positions
* Ask yourself: "Would I buy this if nobody was talking about it?"

**Using Maverick to Avoid Hype:**

Hey Maverick, [TICKER] is up [X%] in the last [timeframe] and everyone's talking about it.

Can you help me separate hype from reality:
1. What's driving the price surge (fundamentals or speculation)?
2. Has the business actually improved, or just the stock price?
3. How does current valuation compare to historical and peers?
4. What's the risk that this is a bubble?

Be brutally honest - should I wait for a pullback or is this justified?
```

### Mistake #2: Ignoring Profitability Path

**The Trap:**

* Company growing revenue 100%/year but losing money
* You assume "they'll figure out profitability later"
* Years pass, still unprofitable, cash running out
* Stock collapses

**Real Examples:**

* Uber (unprofitable for 10+ years, finally profitable 2023)
* WeWork (never achieved profitability, collapsed)
* Many 2020-2021 SPACs (still burning cash, stocks down 80-90%)

**The Fix:**

* Ask: "How and when will they become profitable?"
* Check cash burn rate vs. cash on hand (runway)
* Look for improving unit economics (gross margins)
* If no clear path to profitability in 3-5 years, avoid

**Check with Money:**

```
Hey Money Monty, [TICKER] is growing fast but not profitable. Can you assess:

1. How much cash are they burning per quarter?
2. How much cash do they have on hand?
3. How many quarters of runway before they need to raise more money?
4. What are their gross margins (improving or stable?)
5. What's the path to profitability (timeline and strategy)?

Is this sustainable or risky?
```

### Mistake #3: Overconcentration

**The Trap:**

* You find one growth stock you love
* Put 30-50% of portfolio in it
* Stock crashes 60%
* Your entire portfolio down 20-30%

**Example:**

* 50% in Tesla (2021)
* Tesla drops 70% (2022)
* Portfolio down 35%
* Takes years to recover

**The Fix:**

* Max 10-15% per stock
* 15-20 stocks minimum for growth portfolio
* Even your "highest conviction" pick: Max 15%

### Mistake #4: Falling in Love with Stocks

**The Trap:**

* You bought a stock and it's done well
* You're emotionally attached
* Stock becomes overvalued (PEG > 3, P/E > 80)
* You refuse to trim/sell
* Stock crashes, you give back all gains

**The Fix:**

* Have sell disciplines:
  * Trim when PEG exceeds 3.0
  * Trim when position exceeds 20% of portfolio
  * Sell if fundamentals deteriorate
* Remember: You married your spouse, not your stocks

### Mistake #5: Panic Selling During Corrections

**The Trap:**

* Market corrects 20-30%
* Your growth stocks down 40-50%
* You panic sell to "stop the bleeding"
* Market recovers, you miss the rebound

**Example:**

* Sell growth stocks in March 2020 COVID crash
* Miss the 100%+ recovery over next 12 months

**The Fix:**

* Don't sell on price alone
* Ask: "Have the fundamentals changed?"
* If thesis intact: Hold or buy more
* If thesis broken: Then sell

**Use Sage for Perspective:**

```
Hey Sage, my growth portfolio is down 35% in this correction. I'm tempted to sell everything.

Can you help me think through this:
1. Historically, what % of 30-40% corrections fully recovered within 2 years?
2. For my holdings [list them], have fundamentals actually deteriorated?
3. What's the base case for recovery over next 1-3 years?
4. Should I hold, sell some, or actually buy more?

I need rational perspective, not emotional reaction.
```

## Using Maverick for Growth Investing

### Best Prompts for Finding Growth Stocks

**Weekly Growth Screen:**

```
Hey Maverick, run me a weekly screen for new high-growth opportunities:

GROWTH:
- Revenue growth: 30%+ annually
- Earnings growth: 25%+ annually (or path to profitability)
- Market cap: $2B - $50B

QUALITY:
- Gross margins: 60%+ (strong unit economics)
- Positive free cash flow OR cash runway of 2+ years
- Insider ownership: >5%

THEMES:
Focus on: AI, Cloud, Cybersecurity, Fintech, Healthtech, Clean Energy

Avoid:
- Recent IPOs (<6 months, too volatile)
- Companies with deteriorating margins

Give me 10-12 stocks with growth narratives.
```

**Emerging Theme Screen:**

```
Hey Maverick, what's the next BIG growth theme that's still early?

Can you identify:
1. 3-5 emerging themes that have 10-year tailwinds
2. Why each theme is positioned to explode
3. 3-4 leading companies in each theme
4. Which companies are best positioned (competitive advantage)
5. Rough valuations (are they buyable or too expensive?)

I want to find the next cloud computing / AI / EV BEFORE it's mainstream.
```

**Breakout Stock Finder:**

```
Hey Maverick, find me stocks that are at inflection points (about to break out):

CRITERIA:
- Revenue growth ACCELERATING (faster each quarter)
- Recent earnings beat + raised guidance
- New product/service launch gaining traction
- Institutional buying increasing
- Stock consolidating after pullback (20-30% off highs)

Market cap: $1B - $30B

These are stocks where momentum is building but haven't gone parabolic yet.
```
