# Set Up Automatic Investing (Dollar-Cost Averaging)

Automate your wealth building with systematic monthly investments. Set it once, become a millionaire decades later.

**⏱️ Time:** 30-45 minutes (one-time setup) **💰 Cost:** $100-1,000+ per month (your contribution amount) **📱 Platform:** Any brokerage **👤 Best for:** Anyone who wants to build wealth without constant effort **🦍 Recommended Companion:** Sage (wisdom on systematic wealth building)

***

## What You'll Learn

* What dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is and why it works
* How to set up automatic transfers from bank to brokerage
* How to set up automatic stock/ETF purchases
* Optimal contribution amounts based on income
* How DCA removes emotions from investing
* The math: How $500/month becomes $1.8 million
* Common DCA mistakes and how to avoid them

***

## Why This Matters

**You're here because:**

* 💰 You want to build wealth systematically
* 🔄 You want investing to be automatic (not dependent on discipline)
* 📈 You understand consistency beats perfection
* 😰 You don't want to time the market
* ⏰ You value your time (don't want to think about investing weekly)

**The truth:** Automatic investing is the secret to wealth for regular people. Every millionaire investor either inherited money or invested consistently for decades. You can't control inheritance, but you CAN automate consistency.

***

## What is Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)?

### The Simple Definition

**Dollar-Cost Averaging = Investing the same dollar amount at regular intervals, regardless of price**

**Instead of:**

* Trying to "time the market" (buying when price is "right")
* Investing lump sums irregularly
* Making emotional decisions

**You do:**

* Invest $X every month on the same day
* Whether market is up or down
* Automatically, without thinking
* For decades

***

### How DCA Works

**Example: Investing $500/month in VOO (S\&P 500 ETF)**

**Month 1: VOO at $400**

* Invest $500 → Buy 1.25 shares
* Total shares: 1.25

**Month 2: VOO drops to $350 (market down)**

* Invest $500 → Buy 1.43 shares (more shares at lower price!)
* Total shares: 2.68
* Average cost per share: $373

**Month 3: VOO at $380**

* Invest $500 → Buy 1.32 shares
* Total shares: 4.00
* Average cost per share: $375

**Month 4: VOO rises to $420**

* Invest $500 → Buy 1.19 shares
* Total shares: 5.19
* Average cost per share: $385
* Current value: $2,180 (invested $2,000)
* Gain: $180 (9%)

**The magic:**

* You bought more shares when price was low (month 2)
* You bought fewer shares when price was high (month 4)
* Your average cost is better than if you timed it poorly
* Works automatically without emotion

***

### DCA vs Lump Sum vs Timing

**Scenario: You have $12,000 to invest**

**Strategy A: Lump Sum (Invest all $12k today)**

* Pros: Statistically best 2/3 of the time (market usually goes up)
* Cons: Maximum regret if market drops tomorrow
* Best for: Experienced investors comfortable with volatility

**Strategy B: DCA ($1,000/month for 12 months)**

* Pros: Reduces timing risk, psychologically easier, smooths entry
* Cons: Might miss gains if market goes straight up
* Best for: Beginners, anyone nervous about lump sum

**Strategy C: Market Timing (Wait for "dip")**

* Pros: None (feels smart but isn't)
* Cons: Miss entire gains waiting, impossible to time bottom, paralysis
* Best for: No one (avoid this)

**Data:**

* Lump sum beats DCA 66% of the time historically
* But DCA beats market timing 95% of the time
* DCA provides better sleep for beginners (reduced regret)

**Recommendation:** Use DCA for ongoing contributions (monthly investing). Use lump sum if you inherit or receive bonus.

## The Math: How DCA Builds Millions

### Example 1: The $500/Month Millionaire

**Age 25, invests $500/month until age 65:**

* Monthly: $500
* Years: 40
* Total invested: $240,000
* At 10% annual return: **$3,162,033**

**You became a multi-millionaire investing $500/month.**

***

### Example 2: The $250/Month Half-Millionaire

**Age 30, invests $250/month until age 65:**

* Monthly: $250
* Years: 35
* Total invested: $105,000
* At 10% annual return: **$886,655**

**Nearly a millionaire from $250/month.**

***

### Example 3: The $1,000/Month Multi-Millionaire

**Age 22, invests $1,000/month until age 65:**

* Monthly: $1,000
* Years: 43
* Total invested: $516,000
* At 10% annual return: **$7,371,490**

**Over $7 million from $1,000/month for 43 years.**

***

### The Power of Starting Early

**Two investors, both invest $500/month:**

**Investor A: Starts at age 25, stops at 35 (10 years)**

* Total invested: $60,000 (120 months × $500)
* At age 65 (30 years of compounding after stopping): **$1,365,227**

**Investor B: Starts at age 35, continues to 65 (30 years)**

* Total invested: $180,000 (360 months × $500)
* At age 65: **$1,019,017**

**Investor A invested $120,000 LESS but ended with $346,210 MORE.**

**Starting 10 years earlier > Investing 3x more money.**

***

## Step 1: Determine Your Monthly Contribution

### The 50/30/20 Rule

**Allocate your after-tax income:**

* 50% Needs (rent, food, utilities, transportation)
* 30% Wants (entertainment, dining, hobbies)
* 20% Savings + Investing

**Example: $4,000/month take-home pay**

* Needs: $2,000
* Wants: $1,200
* Savings/Investing: $800

**Split the 20%:**

* Emergency fund building: $300/month (until 6 months saved)
* Investing: $500/month
* After emergency fund complete: $800/month investing

***

### Income-Based Guidelines

**Conservative (10% of gross income):**

| Gross Income  | Monthly Investment |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| $40,000/year  | $333/month         |
| $60,000/year  | $500/month         |
| $80,000/year  | $667/month         |
| $100,000/year | $833/month         |

**Moderate (15% of gross income):**

| Gross Income  | Monthly Investment |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| $40,000/year  | $500/month         |
| $60,000/year  | $750/month         |
| $80,000/year  | $1,000/month       |
| $100,000/year | $1,250/month       |

| $60,000/year  | $1,000-1,250/month |
| $80,000/year  | $1,333-1,667/month |
| $100,000/year | $1,667-2,083/month |

### Start Small, Increase Over Time

**Don't wait until you can afford "the perfect amount"**

**Year 1: Start with what you can afford**

* $100/month if that's all you have
* Build habit and confidence

**Year 2: Increase by 10-20%**

* $100 → $120/month
* As income grows or expenses decrease

**Year 3-5: Keep increasing**

* $120 → $150 → $200
* Lifestyle creep in reverse (invest raises)

**Year 10: You're investing significant amounts**

* $200 → $500+ per month
* Compounding accelerates

**The key: START NOW with ANY amount, increase over time.**

***

* $100 → VXUS (20% International)
* $50 → BND (10% Bonds)

**Set up three automatic investments, same day each month.**

***

### Single-Fund Approach (Simplest)

* $500 → VT (100% Total World Stock)

**One automatic investment. Done.**

***

### Aggressive Growth Approach

**Total: $1,000/month (Age 25-35)**

* $600 → VTI (60% Total U.S.)
* $300 → VXUS (30% International)
* $100 → QQQ (10% Tech/Growth)

***

***

## Step 6: Optimization Strategies

### Timing Your Contributions

**Best day to invest monthly:**

**Option 1: 1st of month**

* Easy to remember
* After payday for most people
* Consistent

**Option 2: Day after paycheck**

* Ensures money is available
* "Pay yourself first" mentality
* Avoids spending it

**Option 3: 15th of month**

* Middle of month
* Some people's payday
* Alternative to 1st

**Does timing matter?**

* Not really. Consistency > perfection.
* Monthly on any day beats sporadic investing.

***

### Increasing Contributions Over Time

**Strategy 1: Annual Raise Rule**

* Every January, increase contribution by 10%
* $500/month → $550/month next year
* Matches income growth typically

**Strategy 2: Invest Half of Raises**

* Get 5% raise? Increase investing by 2.5%
* If making $4,000/month, raise to $4,200
* Increase investing from $500 to $550
* Lifestyle improves + Investing increases

**Strategy 3: Plateau Strategy**

* Start: $200/month
* Every 6 months: Increase by $50
* Year 1: $200 → $250
* Year 2: $300 → $350
* Year 5: $600/month
* Gradual increase sustainable

***

### Tax-Advantaged Accounts First

**Priority order:**

**1. 401(k) up to employer match**

* If employer matches 5%, contribute 5%
* Free money, take it first
* Example: $5,000 salary → $250/month 401k (gets $250 match)

**2. Max out Roth IRA**

* $7,000/year = $583/month
* Tax-free growth forever
* After 401k match, prioritize this

**3. Finish maxing 401(k)**

* $23,000/year = $1,917/month
* Tax-deferred growth
* If you can afford, max this

**4. Taxable brokerage**

* After maxing tax-advantaged accounts
* No limits on contributions
* Set up DCA into VOO/VTI

***

## Step 7: Monitoring Your Automated System

### Monthly Check-In (5 minutes)

**Review:**

1. Did automatic transfer execute? ✓
2. Did automatic investment execute? ✓
3. Any errors or failures? (fix if yes)
4. Total contributed this year: $\_\_\_\_
5. Current portfolio value: $\_\_\_\_

**That's it. 5 minutes per month.**

***

### Quarterly Deep Dive (30 minutes)

**Every 3 months:**

1. Review overall portfolio performance
2. Check asset allocation (still at target?)
3. Assess if contribution amount still appropriate
4. Consider increasing contribution if income grew
5. Ask Money Monty to analyze portfolio

**Example quarterly review:**

```
Money, review my automated investing strategy.
I invest $500/month split:
- $350 VOO
- $100 VXUS
- $50 BND

I'm [age] and planning to retire at [retirement age].
Is this optimal? Should I adjust?
```

***

### Annual Review (1-2 hours)

**Every January:**

1. Calculate total contributions for year
2. Calculate total gains/losses
3. Rebalance portfolio back to target allocation
4. Increase monthly contribution (10% increase recommended)
5. Update investment policy statement if life changed
6. Celebrate progress!

***

## Common DCA Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Stopping During Market Drops

**The scenario:**

* Market crashes 30%
* "I'll pause investing until it recovers"
* Stop automatic contributions

**Why it's wrong:**

* You're buying at DISCOUNT during crashes
* Stopping means you miss the best prices
* Defeats entire purpose of DCA

**Example:**

* Month 1: Buy at $400
* Month 2: Market crashes, price $280 (30% off!)
* If you stop: You miss buying at $280
* If you continue: You get 43% more shares for same money!

**The fix:**

* Never stop during crashes
* If anything, INCREASE contributions during major drops
* Buy MORE when others panic

***

### Mistake #2: Increasing Spending Instead of Investing

**The scenario:**

* Get 10% raise ($500/month more)
* Lifestyle inflation: Buy nicer car, bigger apartment
* Don't increase investing
* Still investing same $500/month despite higher income

**What should happen:**

* Get 10% raise
* Invest at least 50% of raise ($250/month)
* $500/month → $750/month investing
* Modest lifestyle improvement with other half

**The result over 30 years:**

* Scenario A (don't increase): $1,774,728
* Scenario B (increase by $250): $2,662,092
* **Difference: $887,364 from investing half of raise**

***

### Mistake #3: Trying to Time DCA

**The scenario:**

* Automatic investment set for 1st of month
* Market feels "high" on 1st
* Cancel automatic purchase
* "I'll wait for a dip"
* Dip never comes
* Month ends, you didn't invest
* Repeat for 6 months
* Lost 6 months of compounding

**The fix:**

* Set it and forget it
* Never override automatic investments
* Trust the system

***

### Mistake #4: Not Adjusting for Life Changes

**The scenario:**

* Set up $500/month DCA 5 years ago
* Income doubled since then
* Still investing only $500/month
* Could easily afford $1,000/month now

**The fix:**

* Review annually
* Increase contributions as income grows
* Lifestyle creep is enemy of wealth
* Invest your raises

***

### Mistake #5: Forgetting About It Completely

**The scenario:**

* Set up automated investing
* Never check again
* 10 years later: Password to account forgotten
* No idea how much wealth built
* No optimization, no increases, no rebalancing

**The fix:**

* Monthly 5-minute check
* Quarterly 30-minute review
* Annual deep dive and rebalancing
* Stay engaged without obsessing
