## What Are Market Sectors?

### The 11 S&P Sectors (GICS Classification)

The **Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS)** divides the stock market into 11 sectors:

| Sector | What It Includes | Examples |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| **1. Technology** | Software, hardware, semiconductors, IT services | Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Adobe |
| **2. Healthcare** | Pharmaceuticals, biotech, medical devices, insurers | Johnson & Johnson, UnitedHealth, Pfizer |
| **3. Financials** | Banks, insurance, investment firms, REITs | JPMorgan, Berkshire Hathaway, Visa |
| **4. Consumer Discretionary** | Retail, entertainment, autos, restaurants | Amazon, Tesla, Nike, McDonald's |
| **5. Consumer Staples** | Food, beverages, household products, tobacco | Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, Walmart |
| **6. Industrials** | Aerospace, defense, construction, machinery | Boeing, Caterpillar, 3M, GE |
| **7. Energy** | Oil, gas, renewables, equipment & services | ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips |
| **8. Materials** | Chemicals, metals, mining, packaging | Dow Chemical, Newmont Mining, Freeport |
| **9. Utilities** | Electric, gas, water utilities | NextEra Energy, Duke Energy, Southern Co. |
| **10. Real Estate** | REITs, real estate management | American Tower, Prologis, Simon Property |
| **11. Communication Services** | Telecom, media, entertainment | Meta, Alphabet (Google), Netflix, AT&T |

### S&P 500 Sector Weightings (2024)

**Current sector weights in the S&P 500:**

1. **Technology:** ~28% (largest sector)
2. **Financials:** ~13%
3. **Healthcare:** ~13%
4. **Consumer Discretionary:** ~10%
5. **Communication Services:** ~9%
6. **Industrials:** ~8%
7. **Consumer Staples:** ~6%
8. **Energy:** ~4%
9. **Utilities:** ~2%
10. **Real Estate:** ~2%
11. **Materials:** ~2%

**Why this matters:**
- If you own SPY (S&P 500 ETF), you're already 28% tech
- This creates concentration risk (1 sector = 1/4 of your portfolio)
- Understanding sector weights helps you diversify better

## Why Sector Diversification Matters

### Risk #1: Sector-Specific Crashes

**Historical sector crashes:**

**2000-2002 (Tech Crash):**
- Technology sector: -78%
- S&P 500 overall: -49%
- If you were 100% tech: Devastating
- If you were diversified: Painful but survivable

**2008-2009 (Financial Crisis):**
- Financials sector: -83%
- S&P 500 overall: -57%
- Banks and insurance crushed
- Healthcare and Consumer Staples held up better

**2020 (COVID Crash + Recovery):**
- Energy sector: -37% (for full year)
- Airlines/Travel: -50% to -70%
- Tech sector: +43% (for full year)
- Massive sector divergence

**The Lesson:**
If you're overweight in the wrong sector during a crisis, you suffer disproportionately.

### Risk #2: Concentration in Declining Sectors

**Secular decline examples:**

**2010s - Traditional Retail:**
- Department stores (Macy's, JCPenney, Sears): -70% to -99%
- E-commerce (Amazon) grew exponentially
- Retail sector lagged entire decade

**2010s - Energy:**
- Oil/gas stocks: Flat to negative returns for decade
- Renewable energy: Triple-digit returns
- Energy was worst-performing sector (2010-2020)

**The Lesson:**
Some sectors can underperform for decades due to structural changes.

### Risk #3: Missing Growth in Other Sectors

**Opportunity cost example:**

**Portfolio A (Over-concentrated in Financials):**
- 2010-2020 return: ~12% annually
- Missed tech boom

**Portfolio B (Balanced across sectors):**
- 2010-2020 return: ~14% annually
- Participated in tech + healthcare growth

**Portfolio C (Overweight Tech + Healthcare):**
- 2010-2020 return: ~18% annually
- Captured highest-growth sectors

**Difference over 10 years on $100,000:**
- Portfolio A: $311,000
- Portfolio B: $371,000
- Portfolio C: $526,000

**The Lesson:**
Sector allocation can be worth +6% annually ($215k difference on $100k).

## Building Your Sector Allocation

### Approach #1: Market-Weight Allocation (Simplest)

**Strategy:** Match the S&P 500 sector weights

**Allocation (based on current S&P 500):**
- 28% Technology
- 13% Financials
- 13% Healthcare
- 10% Consumer Discretionary
- 9% Communication Services
- 8% Industrials
- 6% Consumer Staples
- 4% Energy
- 2% Utilities
- 2% Real Estate
- 2% Materials

**How to implement:**
- Buy SPY or VOO (instant market-weight allocation)
- Or build your own using sector ETFs (see below)

**Pros:**
- Simple, proven allocation
- Matches market performance
- No need to predict which sectors will outperform

**Cons:**
- High concentration in tech (28%)
- May underweight sectors you prefer
- No customization for your goals

**Best for:** Beginners who want to match the market

---

### Approach #2: Equal-Weight Allocation (Balanced)

**Strategy:** Equal weight to each sector (9% each for 11 sectors)

**Allocation:**
- 9% Technology
- 9% Financials
- 9% Healthcare
- 9% Consumer Discretionary
- 9% Communication Services
- 9% Industrials
- 9% Consumer Staples
- 9% Energy
- 9% Utilities
- 9% Real Estate
- 9% Materials

(Total: 99%, leave 1% cash for flexibility)

**Pros:**
- True diversification (no over-concentration)
- Less dependent on tech sector performance
- Automatically "buys low, sells high" when rebalancing
- Historically outperforms market-weight by ~1-2% annually

**Cons:**
- Requires more frequent rebalancing
- May underperform if tech continues dominating
- More trades = potentially more taxes

**Best for:** Investors who want true sector balance

---

### Approach #3: Custom Allocation (Advanced)

**Strategy:** Customize based on your goals, timeline, and economic outlook

**Example: Growth-Oriented (Age 30, 30-year horizon)**

**Allocation:**
- 35% Technology (overweight for growth)
- 15% Healthcare (growth + defensive)
- 12% Consumer Discretionary (growth)
- 10% Financials
- 8% Communication Services
- 8% Industrials
- 5% Consumer Staples (underweight, less need for defense)
- 3% Energy
- 2% Materials
- 1% Utilities (underweight, too slow for young investor)
- 1% Real Estate

**Rationale:**
- Heavy in growth sectors (tech, healthcare, consumer discretionary)
- Light on defensive/low-growth sectors (utilities, staples)
- Time horizon allows for higher risk

---

**Example: Balanced (Age 45, 20-year horizon)**

**Allocation:**
- 22% Technology (slightly below market-weight)
- 15% Healthcare
- 12% Financials
- 10% Consumer Staples (increased defense)
- 10% Consumer Discretionary
- 8% Industrials
- 7% Communication Services
- 5% Energy
- 5% Utilities (increased defense)
- 3% Real Estate
- 3% Materials

**Rationale:**
- Balanced between growth and defense
- Modest tilt toward stability (staples, utilities up)
- Reduced tech concentration (risk management)

---

**Example: Conservative/Income (Age 60, 10-year horizon)**

**Allocation:**
- 15% Technology (reduced, too volatile)
- 18% Healthcare (defensive growth)
- 15% Consumer Staples (defense + dividends)
- 12% Utilities (high dividends, stability)
- 10% Financials (dividend income)
- 10% Real Estate (REIT income)
- 8% Industrials
- 5% Communication Services
- 4% Consumer Discretionary (reduced exposure)
- 2% Energy
- 1% Materials

**Rationale:**
- Heavy in defensive sectors (staples, utilities, healthcare)
- Dividend-focused sectors (REITs, utilities, staples)
- Reduced volatility (less tech, less discretionary)
- Still some growth (healthcare, industrials)

---

- Reduced research burden (only analyze 5 stocks)
- Can express high-conviction ideas with satellite

**Cons:**
- Potential overlap (VGT holds MSFT and NVDA too)
- More complex to rebalance
- Still requires some stock picking skill

---

## Rebalancing Your Sector Allocation

### When to Rebalance

**Option 1: Calendar Rebalancing**
- Rebalance every 6-12 months on a set date
- Simple, no monitoring required
- Example: Every January 1st

**Option 2: Threshold Rebalancing**
- Rebalance when any sector drifts >5% from target
- More responsive to market changes
- Example: Technology target is 25%, rebalance if it hits 30% or 20%

**Option 3: Hybrid**
- Check quarterly, rebalance if any sector is >5% off target
- Balance between calendar and threshold approaches

**Ask Sage:**
```
Hey Sage, should I rebalance my sector allocation?

Current allocation:
- Technology: [%]
- Healthcare: [%]
- [list all 11 sectors with current %]

Target allocation:
- Technology: [%]
- Healthcare: [%]
- [list all 11 sectors with target %]

Which sectors are significantly off target? What trades should I make to rebalance?
```

### How to Rebalance

**Method 1: Sell Overweight, Buy Underweight**

**Example:**
- Technology drifted from 25% target to 35% (overweight by 10%)
- Energy drifted from 5% target to 3% (underweight by 2%)

**Action:**
- Sell 10% of tech holdings
- Buy energy with proceeds
- Results in closer to target allocation

**Pros:** Mechanically rebalances to target
**Cons:** Triggers capital gains taxes (in taxable accounts)

---

**Method 2: Direct New Contributions to Underweight Sectors**

**Example:**
- Technology: 35% (overweight)
- Energy: 3% (underweight)
- Adding $1,000 new money

**Action:**
- Put $500 in energy (brings it closer to 5% target)
- Put $300 in other underweight sectors
- Put $200 in balanced sectors
- Don't add any to technology

**Pros:** No selling (no taxes), still rebalances over time
**Cons:** Slower to rebalance

**Best for:** Taxable accounts where you want to avoid capital gains

---

**Method 3: Harvest Tax Losses + Rebalance**

**Example:**
- Technology up 50% (overweight, would trigger big tax bill if sold)
- Energy down 20% (underweight, can sell at a loss)

**Action:**
- Sell energy position at a loss (creates tax loss to harvest)
- Immediately buy it back in correct proportion
- Use tax loss to offset gains from trimming tech
- Sell some tech (offset by energy loss)
- Rebalance to targets

**Pros:** Rebalance while minimizing tax impact
**Cons:** Requires careful planning, watch out for wash sales

---

## Using Money to Analyze Sectors

### Sector Health Check

**Prompt:**
```
Hey Money, can you give me a health check on the [SECTOR] sector?

Analyze:
1. Recent performance (YTD, 1-year, 3-year returns)
2. Earnings growth trends for sector
3. Valuation (P/E ratio vs. historical average)
4. Major tailwinds and headwinds
5. Top-performing stocks in the sector
6. Underperforming stocks in the sector
7. Overall outlook: Bullish, neutral, or bearish?

I want to understand if I should be overweight, neutral, or underweight this sector.
```

### Sector Comparison

**Prompt:**
```
Hey Money, I'm trying to decide between increasing my allocation to [SECTOR A] or [SECTOR B].

Can you compare:
1. Recent performance trends
2. Valuation (which is cheaper?)
3. Growth outlook (which has better earnings prospects?)
4. Risk factors for each
5. Which is better positioned for the current economic environment?

Help me decide where to allocate new capital.
```

### Finding Best Stocks in a Sector

**Prompt:**
```
Hey Money, I want to add exposure to the [SECTOR] sector.

Can you suggest the top 5 stocks in this sector based on:
1. Strong fundamentals (earnings growth, margins, ROE)
2. Reasonable valuation (not wildly expensive)
3. Competitive positioning (market leaders)
4. Analyst sentiment

I want to buy 1-2 of the best stocks in this sector.
```

## Common Sector Allocation Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Unintentional Concentration

**The Trap:**
You think you're diversified, but you're actually concentrated.

**Example:**
- Own SPY (28% tech)
- Also own individual tech stocks (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA)
- Also own QQQ (tech-heavy)
- Actual tech allocation: 40-50% of portfolio!

**The Fix:**
- Calculate your TRUE sector exposure (including all holdings)
- If you own S&P 500 fund, account for its sector weights
- Adjust individual holdings to compensate

**Ask Sage:**
```
Hey Sage, calculate my true sector allocation:

I own:
- 50% SPY (S&P 500)
- 15% QQQ (Nasdaq-100)
- 10% MSFT
- 10% AAPL
- 10% JNJ
- 5% XOM

What's my ACTUAL sector allocation across all holdings? Am I over-concentrated in any sector?
```

### Mistake #2: Chasing Last Year's Winner

**The Trap:**
- 2023: Tech sector up 50%
- 2024: You go all-in on tech
- 2024: Tech underperforms, other sectors lead

**Example:**
- Energy was best sector in 2022 (+60%)
- Everyone loaded up on energy in 2023
- Energy was worst sector in 2023 (-10%)

**The Fix:**
- Don't chase performance
- Rebalance AWAY from outperformers (sell high)
- Rebalance INTO underperformers (buy low)
- This forces you to buy low, sell high

### Mistake #3: Ignoring Valuations

**The Trap:**
Staying overweight in expensive sectors just because "they always go up"

**Example (2021):**
- Tech sector P/E: 35× (vs. historical 22×)
- Energy sector P/E: 10× (vs. historical 15×)
- Investors: "Tech is the future, who cares about valuation!"
- 2022: Tech -30%, Energy +60%

**The Fix:**
- Compare sector P/E ratios to historical averages
- Overweight sectors trading below historical P/E
- Underweight sectors trading above historical P/E

**Ask Money:**
```
Hey Money, which sectors are cheap or expensive right now based on historical P/E ratios?

For each sector:
1. Current P/E ratio
2. 10-year historical average P/E
3. Is it expensive, fairly valued, or cheap?

Help me identify which sectors are good values.

### Mistake #4: Market Timing Based on Predictions

**The Trap:**
"I think a recession is coming, so I'm going 100% consumer staples and utilities."

**What usually happens:**
- Recession doesn't come for 2 years
- You miss growth in tech, discretionary
- When recession finally comes, it's already priced in

**The Fix:**
- Don't go to extremes (0% or 100% of a sector)
- Use tactical tilts (reduce tech from 28% to 20%, not to 0%)
- Stay diversified even when making calls
- Recognize you might be wrong
