## What is Fundamental Analysis?

### The Simple Definition

**Fundamental Analysis = Evaluating a company's financial health and business to determine if it's a good investment**

**Instead of:**
- Guessing based on stock price movement
- Buying because everyone else is
- Following hot tips

**You do:**
- Analyze the business (what do they sell? Is it growing?)
- Review financial statements (are they profitable? Debt levels?)
- Compare to competitors
- Decide if current price is fair, cheap, or expensive

---

### Fundamental vs Technical Analysis

**Fundamental Analysis (What we're learning):**
- Focuses on company's financial health
- Looks at earnings, revenue, cash flow
- Long-term investing approach
- Answers: "Is this a good business?"

**Technical Analysis (Different approach):**
- Focuses on stock price patterns and charts
- Looks at volume, trends, indicators
- Short-term trading approach
- Answers: "Will price go up soon?"

**For long-term investors: Fundamental analysis is what matters.**

## The Key Financial Metrics

### 1. Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio)

**What it is:**
- Stock Price ÷ Earnings Per Share
- Shows how much investors are paying per dollar of earnings
- Most common valuation metric

**Example:**
- Apple stock: $175
- Earnings per share (EPS): $6.00
- P/E Ratio: $175 / $6.00 = **29.2**

**What it means:**
- Investors are paying $29.20 for every $1 of Apple's earnings
- Lower P/E = potentially undervalued (or troubled company)
- Higher P/E = potentially overvalued (or high growth expectations)

**General guidelines:**
- P/E < 15: Potentially undervalued or low-growth
- P/E 15-25: Average/fair valuation
- P/E > 25: Potentially overvalued or high-growth
- P/E > 50: Very expensive (better be growing fast!)

**Context matters:**
- Tech stocks: Often P/E 25-40 (growth expectations)
- Mature companies: Often P/E 12-20
- Banks: Often P/E 8-15

**Compare to competitors and industry average.**

---

### 2. Earnings Per Share (EPS)

**What it is:**
- Company's profit divided by number of shares
- Shows profitability per share

**Formula:**
- EPS = Net Income ÷ Total Shares Outstanding

**Example:**
- Apple earned $96 billion profit
- 16 billion shares outstanding
- EPS = $96B / 16B = **$6.00 per share**

**What it means:**
- Higher EPS = More profitable
- Growing EPS over time = Good sign
- Declining EPS = Warning sign

**What to look for:**
- EPS growth year-over-year (want 10%+ annually)
- Consistent EPS (not wildly fluctuating)
- Positive EPS (negative = losing money)

---

### 3. Revenue (Sales)

**What it is:**
- Total money company brings in from selling products/services
- Before expenses

**Example:**
- Apple Q4 2023: $89.5 billion revenue
- Sold iPhones, iPads, Macs, Services

**What it means:**
- Growing revenue = Business is expanding
- Flat revenue = Stagnant business
- Declining revenue = Trouble

**Growth rates:**
- 20%+ annually: Excellent growth
- 10-20% annually: Strong growth
- 5-10% annually: Moderate growth
- 0-5% annually: Slow growth
- Negative: Declining (red flag)

---

### 4. Profit Margin

**What it is:**
- Percentage of revenue that becomes profit
- Shows efficiency and pricing power

**Formula:**
- Profit Margin = (Net Income ÷ Revenue) × 100

**Example:**
- Apple revenue: $383 billion
- Apple profit: $97 billion
- Profit Margin = ($97B / $383B) × 100 = **25.3%**

**What it means:**
- Apple keeps 25 cents of every dollar in sales as profit
- Higher margins = More efficient, better pricing power
- Lower margins = Competitive pressure, less efficient

**Industry norms:**
- Software/Tech: 15-40% (high margins)
- Retail: 2-8% (thin margins)
- Finance: 15-30%
- Manufacturing: 5-15%

**Compare to competitors in same industry.**

---

### 5. Debt-to-Equity Ratio

**What it is:**
- Total Debt ÷ Shareholders' Equity
- Shows how much company relies on debt vs equity

**Example:**
- Company has $50 billion debt
- Company has $100 billion equity
- Debt-to-Equity = $50B / $100B = **0.5**

**What it means:**
- 0.5 = For every $1 of equity, company has $0.50 debt (moderate)
- Lower is generally safer
- Higher = More risky (could struggle if business slows)

**Guidelines:**
- < 0.5: Conservative, low debt
- 0.5-1.0: Moderate debt (most companies)
- 1.0-2.0: High debt (concerning)
- > 2.0: Very high debt (risky)

**Exceptions:**
- Banks naturally have high debt (it's their business model)
- REITs often have high debt (leverage real estate)
- Utilities often have high debt (stable cash flows)

---

### 6. Free Cash Flow (FCF)

**What it is:**
- Cash generated after paying for operations and capital expenditures
- The "real" cash available for shareholders

**Formula:**
- FCF = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures

**Example:**
- Apple operating cash flow: $110 billion
- Capital expenditures: $10 billion
- FCF = $110B - $10B = **$100 billion**

**What it means:**
- Positive FCF = Company generates cash (good!)
- Negative FCF = Company burns cash (concerning)
- Growing FCF = Business becoming more cash-generative

**Why it matters more than earnings:**
- Earnings can be manipulated with accounting
- Cash flow is harder to fake
- FCF shows actual cash the company can:
  - Pay dividends
  - Buy back stock
  - Pay down debt
  - Reinvest in growth

---

### 7. Return on Equity (ROE)

**What it is:**
- How efficiently company generates profit from shareholders' equity
- Profitability metric

**Formula:**
- ROE = (Net Income ÷ Shareholders' Equity) × 100

**Example:**
- Company net income: $20 billion
- Shareholders' equity: $100 billion
- ROE = ($20B / $100B) × 100 = **20%**

**What it means:**
- For every $1 of equity, company generates $0.20 profit
- Higher ROE = More efficient at generating profit

**Guidelines:**
- ROE > 15%: Excellent
- ROE 10-15%: Good
- ROE 5-10%: Average
- ROE < 5%: Poor

**Best companies:** Apple 150%+, Microsoft 40%+, Coca-Cola 40%+

---

### 8. Dividend Yield (For Income Investors)

**What it is:**
- Annual dividend per share ÷ stock price
- Shows income return from dividends

**Example:**
- Coca-Cola stock: $60
- Annual dividend: $1.84 per share
- Dividend yield = ($1.84 / $60) × 100 = **3.1%**

**What it means:**
- If you buy at $60, you earn $1.84/year in dividends (3.1% yield)
- Paid quarterly usually

**Guidelines:**
- 0-2%: Low yield (growth companies)
- 2-4%: Moderate yield (balanced)
- 4-6%: High yield (mature companies)
- 6%+: Very high yield (risky? or REIT/utility)

**Warning:** Very high yields (8-15%) often signal trouble. Company may cut dividend.
