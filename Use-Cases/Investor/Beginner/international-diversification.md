## Why Invest Internationally?

### Reason #1: The U.S. is Only 60% of Global Markets

**Global Market Capitalization (2024):**
- 🇺🇸 **United States:** ~60% of global stock market
- 🌍 **Rest of World:** ~40% of global stock market

**Breakdown by region:**
- Europe: ~15% (UK, Germany, France, Switzerland)
- Japan: ~6%
- China: ~5%
- Canada: ~3%
- Emerging Markets (other): ~8%
- Australia/Asia Pacific: ~3%

**If you only invest in the U.S., you're ignoring 40% of global investment opportunities.**

### Reason #2: Diversification Reduces Risk

**Not all markets move together.**

**Historical correlation (U.S. vs International):**
- U.S. stocks vs. International stocks: ~0.70 correlation
- Meaning: They move in the same direction ~70% of the time, but diverge 30% of the time

**Example (2008-2023 returns):**

| Period | U.S. Stocks (VTI) | International Stocks (VXUS) |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| 2008 (Financial Crisis) | -37% | -45% (worse) |
| 2009 (Recovery) | +28% | +42% (better!) |
| 2010-2020 (Decade) | +257% | +51% (much worse) |
| 2021 | +26% | +8% |
| 2022 | -20% | -17% (better) |
| 2023 | +26% | +16% |

**The Lesson:**
- International outperforms during some periods
- U.S. outperforms during others
- Holding both = smoother overall returns

**Portfolio volatility with international diversification:**
- 100% U.S. stocks: 15-18% annual volatility
- 80% U.S., 20% International: 14-16% volatility (slightly lower)
- 60% U.S., 40% International: 13-15% volatility (more reduction)

**Diversification benefit:** -1% to -3% volatility reduction

### Reason #3: Access to Unique Opportunities

**Companies and industries not available in the U.S.:**

**Developed Markets:**
- 🇨🇭 **Swiss pharmaceuticals:** Roche, Novartis
- 🇩🇪 **German manufacturing:** BMW, Siemens, SAP
- 🇯🇵 **Japanese tech:** Toyota, Sony, Nintendo
- 🇫🇷 **French luxury:** LVMH, Hermes, L'Oreal
- 🇬🇧 **British banking:** HSBC, Barclays
- 🇰🇷 **Korean semiconductors:** Samsung, SK Hynix

**Emerging Markets:**
- 🇹🇼 **Taiwan chips:** TSMC (makes chips for Apple, NVIDIA)
- 🇨🇳 **Chinese e-commerce:** Alibaba, Tencent, JD.com
- 🇮🇳 **Indian IT services:** Infosys, TCS
- 🇧🇷 **Brazilian commodities:** Vale (iron ore), Petrobras (oil)

**Some of the world's best companies aren't American!**

### Reason #4: Hedge Against U.S. Underperformance

**Historical cycles: U.S. vs. International leadership**

**2000-2010 (International Won):**
- U.S. stocks (S&P 500): -9% total (lost decade!)
- International stocks (MSCI EAFE): +19% total
- Emerging Markets: +154% (crushed U.S.!)

**2010-2020 (U.S. Won):**
- U.S. stocks: +257% (best decade ever)
- International stocks: +51% (lagged severely)
- Emerging Markets: +37%

**Lesson:** Leadership rotates between regions over decades.

**If you're 100% U.S.:**
- 2000-2010: You made 0% while international made 19-154%
- 2010-2020: You crushed it

**If you're globally diversified:**
- You captured BOTH periods (just not at maximum)
- Smoother, more consistent long-term returns

### Reason #5: Currency Diversification

**Holding international stocks = exposure to foreign currencies**

**When the U.S. dollar weakens:**
- Your international investments go UP (foreign currency gains)
- Hedge against dollar decline

**Example:**
- You own European stocks worth €10,000
- EUR/USD = 1.10 ($11,000 value to you)
- Euro strengthens to 1.20
- Same €10,000 now worth $12,000 (even if stock price unchanged)
- **You gained 9% from currency alone!**

**Downside:**
- When dollar strengthens, international stocks go DOWN (currency headwind)

**Net effect over long term:** Averages out, but provides diversification

---

---

## How Much International Exposure?

### Common Allocation Approaches

**1. Market-Weight Approach (40% International)**

**Logic:** Match global market capitalization
- U.S. = 60% of global markets
- International = 40% of global markets
- Therefore: 60% U.S., 40% International

**Example Portfolio ($10,000):**
- $6,000 in VTI (U.S. stocks)
- $3,000 in VEA (Developed markets)
- $1,000 in VWO (Emerging markets)

**Pros:** Mathematically optimal, captures global economy
**Cons:** 40% international feels high for some U.S. investors

**Recommended for:** True believers in global diversification

---

**2. Vanguard's Recommendation (30-40% International)**

**Vanguard research (2012):**
> "International allocation of 30-40% historically optimized risk-adjusted returns for U.S. investors."

**Example Portfolio ($10,000):**
- $7,000 in VTI (U.S. stocks)
- $2,100 in VEA (Developed markets)
- $900 in VWO (Emerging markets)

**Pros:** Research-backed, balanced approach
**Cons:** Still significant international exposure (some prefer less)

**Recommended for:** Evidence-based investors

---

**3. Moderate Approach (20-25% International)**

**Logic:** Meaningful diversification without too much international exposure

**Example Portfolio ($10,000):**
- $7,500 in VTI (U.S. stocks)
- $1,750 in VEA (Developed markets)
- $750 in VWO (Emerging markets)

**Pros:** Diversification benefit, lower international risk
**Cons:** Misses out if international outperforms

**Recommended for:** Moderately conservative investors

---

**4. Conservative Approach (10-15% International)**

**Logic:** Minimal international exposure, mostly U.S.

**Example Portfolio ($10,000):**
- $8,500 in VTI (U.S. stocks)
- $1,000 in VEA (Developed markets)
- $500 in VWO (Emerging markets)

**Pros:** Lower risk, home country bias
**Cons:** Limited diversification benefit

**Recommended for:** Conservative investors, U.S.-focused

---

**5. All-World Approach (Use VT)**

**Simplest:** Buy one fund that holds everything

**ETF:** **VT (Vanguard Total World Stock)**
- Holds 9,000+ stocks globally
- Automatically weights by market cap (~60% U.S., 40% international)
- Expense ratio: 0.07%
- One-fund portfolio!

**Example Portfolio ($10,000):**
- $10,000 in VT (Total world)

**Pros:** Ultimate simplicity, automatic global diversification
**Cons:** Can't customize U.S. vs. international mix

**Recommended for:** "Set it and forget it" investors

## Currency Risk Explained

### What is Currency Risk?

**When you own international stocks, you're exposed to TWO sources of return:**
1. Stock price change (same as U.S. stocks)
2. Currency exchange rate change (unique to international)

**Example:**

**Scenario:** You own German stock (BMW)

**Year 1:**
- BMW stock: €100
- EUR/USD exchange rate: 1.10
- Value to you (USD): $110

**Year 2 (Stock up, Euro down):**
- BMW stock: €110 (+10%)
- EUR/USD exchange rate: 1.00 (Euro weakened)
- Value to you (USD): $110 (0% gain!)

**Result:** Stock went up 10% in Euros, but you made 0% because Euro fell vs. Dollar

**Year 3 (Stock flat, Euro up):**
- BMW stock: €110 (0% change)
- EUR/USD exchange rate: 1.20 (Euro strengthened)
- Value to you (USD): $132 (+20% gain!)

**Result:** Stock was flat, but you made 20% because Euro rose vs. Dollar

### Is Currency Risk Good or Bad?

**It's BOTH:**

**Good (Diversification):**
- Hedges against dollar decline
- Different economies = different currency movements
- Over long term (20-30 years), currency effects average out

**Bad (Volatility):**
- Adds short-term unpredictability
- Can amplify losses (stock down + currency down = double whammy)
- Harder to predict returns

**Historical Impact:**
- Currency can add or subtract 5-15% annually to international returns
- Over 10+ years, usually ±0-2% annual impact (less significant)

### Should You Hedge Currency Risk?

**Currency-Hedged ETFs** (remove currency exposure):
- **HEFA** - Hedged developed markets
- **DBEF** - Hedged Europe
- **DXJ** - Hedged Japan

**Pros of hedging:**
- Removes currency volatility
- Focuses purely on stock returns
- Can outperform during dollar strength

**Cons of hedging:**
- Higher fees (0.30-0.50% vs. 0.05-0.10% unhedged)
- Misses currency gains when dollar weakens
- Reduces diversification benefit

**Vanguard's view:**
> "For long-term investors, currency hedging is generally not recommended. Costs outweigh benefits."

**Recommendation for beginners:** Use UNhedged international ETFs (simpler, cheaper, more diversification)

---

## Tax Considerations

### Foreign Tax Credit

**Many international stocks pay dividends with foreign taxes withheld.**

**Example:**
- French stock pays $100 dividend
- France withholds 25% tax = $25
- You receive $75

**Good news:** You can claim **foreign tax credit** on U.S. taxes
- Reduces your U.S. tax bill by amount of foreign taxes paid
- Recovered in most cases (for developed markets)

**How to claim:**
- Your broker reports foreign taxes on Form 1099-DIV
- Include Form 1116 with your tax return
- IRS credits you back (up to limits)

**Best for:** Holding international stocks in TAXABLE accounts (credit is valuable)

### Tax-Advantaged Accounts

**Roth IRA / Traditional IRA:**
- Foreign tax credit does NOT apply (no tax return for IRA)
- You LOSE the benefit of foreign tax credits

**Best practice:**
- Hold international stocks in TAXABLE accounts (claim foreign tax credit)
- Hold U.S. stocks in IRAs (no foreign tax to worry about)

**Exception:** If you only have IRA, still hold international (diversification > tax optimization)

---

## Common International Investing Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Home Country Bias (0% International)

**The Trap:**
"America is the best! I don't need international stocks."

**Reality:**
- U.S. was worst-performing region 2000-2010 (-9% vs. +19% international)
- You would have made ZERO while international made double-digit returns

**The Fix:**
- Allocate at least 20-30% to international
- Don't let patriotism override diversification
- Remember: Some of the world's best companies aren't American

### Mistake #2: Chasing Recent Performance

**The Trap:**
- 2010-2020: U.S. crushes international (+257% vs. +51%)
- 2021: You go 100% U.S. stocks
- 2022-2030: International outperforms (hypothetically)

**Historical pattern:**
- Leadership rotates every 10-15 years
- Chasing = buying high, selling low

**The Fix:**
- Set target allocation (e.g., 30% international)
- Stick to it regardless of recent performance
- Rebalance INTO underperformers (buy low)

### Mistake #3: Overweighting Emerging Markets

**The Trap:**
"China and India are growing fast! 50% emerging markets!"

**Reality:**
- Emerging markets are EXTREMELY volatile (50-70% crashes possible)
- Currency risk is amplified
- Political risk (government can seize assets, change rules)

**Example (2021-2022):**
- Chinese stocks (MCHI): -50% (regulatory crackdown)
- Destroyed portfolios overweight China

**The Fix:**
- Limit emerging markets to 20-30% of international allocation
- Or 5-10% of total portfolio
- Don't bet the farm on high-growth = high-risk

### Mistake #4: Ignoring Fees

**The Trap:**
Using expensive international funds (0.50-1.00% expense ratios)

**Cost over 30 years:**
- $100,000 at 0.10% fee → $1.0M final value
- $100,000 at 0.70% fee → $840k final value
- **High fees cost you $160,000!**

**The Fix:**
- Use low-cost ETFs:
  - VEA (0.05%), VXUS (0.07%), VWO (0.08%)
- Avoid expensive actively managed international funds

### Mistake #5: Not Rebalancing

**The Trap:**
- Start: 70% U.S., 30% international
- 10 years pass, no rebalancing
- Now: 85% U.S., 15% international (U.S. outperformed)
- You've lost diversification benefit

**The Fix:**
- Rebalance annually or when drift exceeds 5%
- Sell U.S. winners, buy international losers
- Maintain target allocation
