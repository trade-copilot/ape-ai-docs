## What is Tax-Loss Harvesting?

### The Basics

**Tax-loss harvesting** is selling investments at a loss to offset capital gains (and potentially ordinary income) for tax purposes.

**Simple Example:**

**Without Tax-Loss Harvesting:**

* You sell Stock A for $10,000 profit (capital gain)
* You owe taxes: $10,000 × 20% = $2,000 tax bill
* Net profit: $10,000 - $2,000 = $8,000

**With Tax-Loss Harvesting:**

* You sell Stock A for $10,000 profit (capital gain)
* You also sell Stock B for $10,000 loss (capital loss)
* Net capital gain: $10,000 - $10,000 = $0
* You owe taxes: $0
* **Tax savings: $2,000!**
* You immediately buy a similar (but not identical) stock to replace Stock B
* You stay invested while harvesting the tax benefit

**You saved $2,000 in taxes WITHOUT changing your overall market exposure!**

### How It Works

**Step 1:** Identify positions with losses

* Stock bought at $100, now worth $70 = $30 loss per share

**Step 2:** Sell the losing position

* Sell to realize the loss for tax purposes

**Step 3:** Immediately buy a similar investment

* Buy a different but similar stock/ETF
* Maintain market exposure (stay invested)

**Step 4:** Use loss to offset gains

* Report loss on tax return
* Offsets capital gains dollar-for-dollar
* Can also offset $3,000 of ordinary income per year
* Excess losses carry forward to future years

***

## Tax Rules You Must Know

### Rule #1: Capital Gains Offset

**Capital losses offset capital gains in this order:**

**1. Short-term losses offset short-term gains first**

* Short-term = held <1 year
* Taxed as ordinary income (22-37% tax brackets)

**2. Long-term losses offset long-term gains**

* Long-term = held >1 year
* Taxed at preferential rates (0%, 15%, or 20%)

**3. Excess losses offset the other type**

* Remaining short-term losses offset long-term gains
* Remaining long-term losses offset short-term gains

**4. Remaining losses offset $3,000 of ordinary income**

* Maximum $3,000 per year
* Reduces W-2 wages, interest income, etc.

**5. Excess losses carry forward indefinitely**

* No expiration!
* Use in future years following same rules

**Example:**

**2024 Tax Year:**

* Short-term capital gains: $15,000 (from day trading)
* Long-term capital gains: $10,000 (from selling stock held 2 years)
* Harvested losses: $20,000 long-term

**Calculation:**

1. $20,000 long-term loss offsets $10,000 long-term gain → $0 long-term gain
2. Remaining $10,000 loss offsets $10,000 short-term gain → $0 short-term gain
3. Remaining $0, no ordinary income offset
4. Total capital gains: $0 (vs. $25,000 without harvesting)

**Tax Savings:**

* Short-term gains tax saved: $10,000 × 24% = $2,400
* Long-term gains tax saved: $10,000 × 15% = $1,500
* **Total tax savings: $3,900!**

### Rule #2: The Wash Sale Rule (CRITICAL!)

**IRS Wash Sale Rule:**

> You cannot claim a tax loss if you buy a "substantially identical" security within 30 days before or after the sale.

**The 30-Day Rule:**

* 30 days BEFORE the sale
* 30 days AFTER the sale
* Total: 61-day window

**Example of Wash Sale Violation:**

**❌ WRONG WAY:**

* Dec 1: Sell 100 shares VTI at a loss
* Dec 10: Buy 100 shares VTI (9 days later)
* **Result:** WASH SALE! Loss disallowed, no tax benefit

**✅ RIGHT WAY:**

* Dec 1: Sell 100 shares VTI at a loss
* Dec 1: Buy 100 shares SCHB or ITOT (similar but not identical)
* **Result:** Loss allowed, stay invested, no wash sale

**What Counts as "Substantially Identical"?**

**Same ticker = Substantially identical:**

* Can't sell VTI and buy VTI (obviously)
* Can't sell Apple (AAPL) and buy Apple (same stock)

**Same index ETF from same provider = Often substantially identical:**

* VTI (Vanguard Total Market) and VT (Vanguard Total World) = Different (VT includes international)
* VTI and VXUS = Different (one is U.S., one is international)

**Similar but different index = Usually OK:**

* VTI (Total Market) → SCHB (Schwab Total Market) = Different providers, OK!
* VTI (Total Market) → VOO (S\&P 500) = Different index, OK!
* SPY (S\&P 500 ETF) → IVV (S\&P 500 ETF) = Different providers but SAME index, risky

**Individual stocks:**

* Apple → Microsoft = Different companies, OK
* Coca-Cola → PepsiCo = Different companies, OK
* ExxonMobil → Chevron = Different companies, OK

**Bonds:**

* BND (Total Bond) → AGG (Aggregate Bond) = Similar but different, usually OK

**Ask Money Monty to Verify:**

```
Hey Money Monty, I want to harvest a tax loss on [TICKER].

What's a good replacement that:
1. Is similar enough to maintain my market exposure
2. Is different enough to avoid wash sale
3. Has low expense ratio

I need to avoid the wash sale rule!
```

### Rule #3: Loss Limitation ($3,000 per year)

**You can only deduct $3,000 of net capital losses against ordinary income per year.**

**Example:**

**Scenario:**

* Capital gains: $5,000
* Capital losses: $25,000
* Net capital loss: $20,000

**Tax Treatment:**

* $5,000 loss offsets $5,000 gains → $0 capital gains
* $3,000 loss offsets ordinary income (W-2 wages)
* Remaining $12,000 loss → **Carries forward to next year**

**Next Year (2025):**

* You have $12,000 loss carryforward
* New capital gains in 2025: $8,000
* $8,000 of carryforward offsets $8,000 gains → $0 gains
* Remaining $4,000 carryforward available
* Can use $3,000 against ordinary income
* $1,000 carries to 2026

**This can go on for years!** Losses never expire.

***

## When to Harvest Losses

### Scenario #1: Market Crash / Correction

**Best time for tax-loss harvesting = Market crashes**

**Example (December 2022):**

* Market down 20-30% for the year
* Many positions showing significant losses
* Perfect time to harvest

**Strategy:**

1. Identify ALL positions with losses
2. Harvest as many as possible (up to your needs)
3. Immediately replace with similar ETFs
4. Use harvested losses against 2022 gains (or carry forward)

**Typical harvest during crash:**

* $20,000-$50,000 in losses (can offset gains for years!)

### Scenario #2: Rebalancing

**Combine rebalancing with tax-loss harvesting**

**Example:**

**Target allocation:** 60% stocks, 40% bonds **Current allocation:** 55% stocks, 45% bonds (stocks underperformed)

**Traditional rebalancing:**

* Sell bonds, buy stocks (could trigger gains on bonds)

**Tax-loss harvesting rebalancing:**

* Sell losing stock positions (harvest losses)
* Immediately buy different stock ETFs
* Use harvested losses to offset bond gains
* **Result:** Rebalanced AND reduced taxes!

### Scenario #3: End-of-Year Planning

**December = Tax-loss harvesting season**

**Why December?**

* Know your gains for the year
* Can calculate how much loss to harvest
* Offsets gains realized earlier in the year

**Annual process:**

1. November: Review year-to-date capital gains
2. November: Identify positions with losses
3. December 1-15: Execute tax-loss harvesting trades
4. December 31: Ensure 30-day wash sale window doesn't cross into new year (if buying back original)

**Important:** Don't wait until Dec 30th! Give yourself time for wash sale window.

### Scenario #4: Taking Profits

**Whenever you sell winners, harvest losses to offset**

**Example:**

**Plan:** Sell Apple stock (bought at $50, now $200 = $15,000 gain)

**Without harvesting:**

* $15,000 gain × 20% long-term cap gains = $3,000 tax

**With tax-loss harvesting:**

* Identify stocks with $15,000 in losses
* Sell those too (harvest losses)
* Replace with similar stocks
* Net capital gain: $15,000 - $15,000 = $0
* **Tax savings: $3,000!**

***

## How to Execute Tax-Loss Harvesting

### Step 1: Identify Loss Opportunities

**Use your brokerage:**

**Fidelity:**

1. Go to Accounts → Positions
2. Look for "Unrealized Gain/Loss" column
3. Sort by "Unrealized Loss" (most negative first)
4. Identify positions down 10%+

**Schwab:**

1. Portfolio → Holdings
2. View "Gain/Loss" column
3. Filter for losses
4. Check individual lots if needed (for specific lot harvesting)

**Robinhood:**

1. View Holdings
2. Look for red numbers (losses)
3. Calculate loss amount

**E\*TRADE:**

1. Portfolio → Positions
2. "Gain/Loss" column
3. Use "Tax Loss Harvesting Tool" (if available)

**Using Ape AI Money:**

```
Hey Money Monty, help me identify tax-loss harvesting opportunities:

My current positions with losses:
- [TICKER]: Bought at $[price], now $[current price], Loss: $[amount]
- [TICKER]: Bought at $[price], now $[current price], Loss: $[amount]
- [TICKER]: Bought at $[price], now $[current price], Loss: $[amount]

Which losses should I prioritize harvesting? And what are good replacement securities to avoid wash sales?
```

### Step 2: Calculate How Much Loss You Need

**Ask yourself:**

* How much capital gains did I realize this year? (Check 1099-B from last year or YTD trades)
* Do I have gains I plan to realize soon? (selling appreciated stock)
* Do I want to offset ordinary income? (up to $3,000)

**Example Calculation:**

**Your situation:**

* Realized gains so far: $10,000
* Planning to sell Apple (will realize $8,000 gain)
* Total gains: $18,000

**Target loss to harvest:** $18,000 + $3,000 (ordinary income offset) = $21,000

**Action:**

* Identify positions with $21,000 in total losses
* Harvest those

### Step 3: Choose Replacement Securities

**Goal:** Replace sold position with similar (but not identical) investment

**Common ETF Swaps:**

| Sell (Harvest Loss)              | Buy (Replacement)                                                 | Strategy                   |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| VTI (Vanguard Total Market)      | SCHB (Schwab Total Market) OR ITOT (iShares Total Market)         | U.S. total market exposure |
| VOO (Vanguard S\&P 500)          | SPY (SPDR S\&P 500) OR IVV (iShares S\&P 500)                     | S\&P 500 exposure          |
| VEA (Vanguard Developed Markets) | SCHF (Schwab International) OR IEFA (iShares Developed Markets)   | International developed    |
| VWO (Vanguard Emerging Markets)  | IEMG (iShares Emerging Markets) OR SCHE (Schwab Emerging Markets) | Emerging markets           |
| BND (Vanguard Total Bond)        | AGG (iShares Aggregate Bond) OR SCHZ (Schwab Aggregate Bond)      | U.S. bonds                 |
| QQQ (Nasdaq-100)                 | ONEQ (Nasdaq Composite) OR QQQM (Nasdaq-100 mini)                 | Tech-heavy growth          |

**Individual Stock Swaps (Same Sector):**

| Sell (Harvest Loss) | Buy (Replacement)                          | Sector           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Apple (AAPL)        | Microsoft (MSFT)                           | Tech - large cap |
| Amazon (AMZN)       | Shopify (SHOP) OR Alibaba (BABA)           | E-commerce       |
| Tesla (TSLA)        | Rivian (RIVN) OR Lucid (LCID)              | EVs              |
| JPMorgan (JPM)      | Bank of America (BAC) OR Wells Fargo (WFC) | Banks            |
| ExxonMobil (XOM)    | Chevron (CVX) OR ConocoPhillips (COP)      | Energy           |

**Ask Money Monty for Suggestions:**

```
Hey Money Monty, I need to harvest a tax loss on [TICKER] (down $[amount]).

What's a good replacement stock/ETF that:
1. Has similar exposure (sector, market cap, geography)
2. Is different enough to avoid wash sale
3. Ideally has lower expense ratio or better performance history

Give me 2-3 options to choose from.
```

### Step 4: Execute the Trades (Same Day!)

**CRITICAL: Execute BOTH trades on the same day**

**Why?** Stay invested to avoid missing market movements

**Process:**

**Trade 1 - SELL (Harvest Loss):**

1. Go to position in brokerage
2. Click "Sell"
3. Enter full position (or amount you want to harvest)
4. Order type: Market order (immediate execution)
5. Submit order
6. **Document:** Date, ticker, shares, loss amount

**Trade 2 - BUY (Replacement):**

1. Immediately (within minutes) search for replacement ticker
2. Click "Buy"
3. Enter dollar amount (same as sale proceeds) OR calculated shares
4. Order type: Market order
5. Submit order
6. **Document:** Date, ticker, shares, cost

**Example Execution:**

**10:00 AM:**

* Sell 100 shares VTI at $220 = $22,000 proceeds
* Cost basis was $250/share = $25,000
* Loss harvested: $3,000

**10:05 AM:**

* Buy $22,000 of SCHB (Schwab Total Market)
* At $50/share = 440 shares
* Now have SCHB instead of VTI (same exposure, no wash sale)

**Result:**

* Stay invested in total market (just different ETF)
* Harvested $3,000 loss for taxes
* Can offset $3,000 in gains or ordinary income

### Step 5: Track for Wash Sale Period

**For the next 30 days after sale:**

**DO NOT:**

* ❌ Buy back the original security (VTI in example above)
* ❌ Have dividend reinvestment buy it (turn off DRIP if applicable)
* ❌ Buy it in another account (IRA, 401k, spouse's account)

**YOU CAN:**

* ✅ Hold the replacement security (SCHB)
* ✅ Buy other different securities
* ✅ Sell the replacement if needed (independent transaction)

**After 31 days:**

* You CAN buy back the original if you prefer
* Wash sale window has closed
* Tax loss is safe

**Calendar Reminder:**

* Set reminder for 31 days after sale
* Note: "Wash sale period ends, can buy \[original ticker] if desired"

### Step 6: Document for Tax Return

**Keep records:**

* Date of sale (losing position)
* Shares sold
* Sale price
* Cost basis
* Loss amount
* Date of purchase (replacement)
* Replacement ticker

**Your broker will report:**

* Form 1099-B (capital gains/losses) in January
* Shows all sales for the year
* Includes whether gain/loss is short-term or long-term

**On your tax return (Form 8949 & Schedule D):**

* Report all capital gains and losses
* Losses will offset gains automatically
* Up to $3,000 excess loss offsets ordinary income
* Remaining losses carry forward to next year (tracked on Schedule D)

**Use tax software or CPA:**

* TurboTax, H\&R Block, etc. guide you through
* Or hire CPA for complex situations

## Advanced Tax-Loss Harvesting Strategies

### Strategy #1: Specific Lot Identification

**What is it?** Selling specific shares you purchased (not FIFO or LIFO)

**Why?** Maximize loss harvesting while keeping winning lots

**Example:**

**You own 300 shares of Apple bought at different times:**

* Lot 1: 100 shares at $100/share (now worth $200) = $10,000 gain
* Lot 2: 100 shares at $180/share (now worth $200) = $2,000 gain
* Lot 3: 100 shares at $220/share (now worth $200) = $2,000 LOSS

**Goal:** Harvest $2,000 loss without selling winning lots

**Action:**

* Specify "Sell Lot 3 only" (100 shares at $220 cost basis)
* Harvest $2,000 loss
* Keep Lots 1 and 2 (let winners run)

**How to do this:**

**Fidelity:**

1. When selling, choose "Specific Shares" instead of "First In, First Out"
2. Select which lots to sell (Lot 3)

**Schwab:**

1. Select "Specific Lot" when placing trade
2. Choose lots with losses

**Robinhood:**

* Not available (uses FIFO automatically) - limitation!

**Best brokerages for lot control:** Fidelity, Schwab, E\*TRADE, Interactive Brokers

### Strategy #2: Layering Losses Over Time

**Don't harvest all losses at once unless you need them**

**Why?**

* You can only use $3,000/year against ordinary income
* Harvesting $50,000 loss might take 10+ years to fully utilize
* Better to harvest $10-15k/year as needed

**Example:**

**2024:**

* Harvest $10,000 loss
* Offset $7,000 in gains + $3,000 ordinary income
* Fully utilized

**2025:**

* Harvest another $12,000 loss
* Offset $9,000 in gains + $3,000 ordinary income
* Fully utilized

**2026:**

* Harvest $15,000 loss
* And so on...

**Benefit:** Spread out tax savings over multiple years, more efficient use

### Strategy #3: Pair Selling

**Sell both winners and losers in same year to net out**

**Example:**

**Goal:** Take profits on Apple (up $20,000) but minimize taxes

**Strategy:**

1. Sell Apple: +$20,000 gain
2. Harvest losses on Tesla, Amazon, etc.: -$20,000 loss
3. Net capital gain: $0
4. Tax owed: $0

**Result:**

* Took profits on Apple (de-risked)
* Stayed invested (bought replacements for harvested positions)
* Paid ZERO capital gains tax

**This is how wealthy investors pay minimal taxes while actively managing portfolios!**

### Strategy #4: Direct Indexing (Advanced/High Net Worth)

**What is it?** Owning individual stocks that replicate an index (instead of ETF)

**Why?** Allows harvesting losses on individual stocks throughout year

**Example:**

**Traditional:** Own 100 shares of SPY (S\&P 500 ETF)

* Can only harvest loss if entire SPY is down

**Direct Indexing:** Own individual shares of all 500 S\&P 500 companies

* If Apple is down but Microsoft is up, harvest Apple loss
* Still maintain S\&P 500 exposure overall
* Many micro-harvesting opportunities

**Benefit:**

* Can harvest $10k-$30k annually even in UP markets
* More tax alpha (extra return from tax savings)

**Downside:**

* Requires $100k-$500k+ portfolio
* Complex to manage (usually use service like Wealthfront, Betterment, Parametric)
* Higher trading costs

**Best for:** High net worth investors ($500k+) in high tax brackets

***

## Common Tax-Loss Harvesting Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Wash Sale Violation

**The Trap:** Buy back too soon (within 30 days)

**Example:**

* Dec 5: Sell VTI at loss
* Dec 20: "Market is recovering, I want VTI back!"
* Buy VTI (only 15 days later)
* **WASH SALE!** Loss disallowed

**The Fix:**

* Wait 31 days
* OR buy different fund permanently
* OR accept replacement is good enough

### Mistake #2: Forgetting About Other Accounts

**The Trap:** Wash sale rule applies across ALL your accounts

**Example:**

* Dec 5: Sell VTI in taxable brokerage (harvest loss)
* Dec 10: Your 401k auto-buys VTI (employer match + contributions)
* **WASH SALE!** Loss disallowed

**Accounts that count:**

* Your IRAs (Traditional, Roth)
* Your 401(k)
* Spouse's accounts
* Joint accounts

**The Fix:**

* Check all accounts before harvesting
* Pause 401k contributions temporarily if necessary
* Use different funds in retirement accounts

### Mistake #3: Harvesting Losses You Don't Need

**The Trap:** Harvest $50,000 loss but only have $5,000 in gains

**Result:**

* Can only use $5,000 + $3,000 = $8,000 this year
* Remaining $42,000 carries forward
* Might take 10+ years to use (opportunity cost of trading fees, time)

**The Fix:**

* Only harvest what you can use (this year + $3,000)
* Save other loss opportunities for future years

### Mistake #4: Not Replacing Immediately

**The Trap:** Sell losing position but wait to buy replacement

**Risk:**

* Market rallies during your "out of market" time
* Miss 5-10% gain in days

**Example (March 2020):**

* March 20: Sell stocks at bottom (harvest losses)
* "I'll wait for better entry point"
* March 23-April: Market rallies 30%+
* You missed entire recovery

**The Fix:**

* SAME DAY replacement purchase
* Within minutes or hours, not days/weeks

### Mistake #5: Selling Long-Term for Short-Term Replacement

**The Trap:**

**What you sell:**

* Stock held 2 years (long-term holding)
* Generates long-term loss (offsets long-term gains at 15-20% tax)

**What you buy:**

* Replacement stock
* Sell it 6 months later (short-term gain)
* Taxed at ordinary income (22-37%)

**Result:**

* You created a short-term gain (higher tax) by selling long-term asset
* Tax inefficient!

**The Fix:**

* Plan to hold replacements long-term too (1+ year)
* Match holding periods when possible

***

## Tax-Loss Harvesting Calculator

**Formula to calculate tax savings:**

```
Tax Savings = (Loss Harvested × Your Tax Rate)
```

**Example:**

**Scenario:**

* Harvested loss: $15,000
* Offset capital gains: $15,000
* Your capital gains tax rate: 15% (long-term)

**Tax Savings:**

* $15,000 × 15% = $2,250 saved

**Scenario 2 (No gains, offset ordinary income):**

* Harvested loss: $10,000
* Offset capital gains: $0
* Offset ordinary income: $3,000 (max allowed)
* Carryforward: $7,000 (for future years)
* Your ordinary income tax rate: 24%

**Tax Savings (this year):**

* $3,000 × 24% = $720 saved

**Future savings (when carryforward is used):**

* $7,000 × 15% (assuming future capital gains) = $1,050

## Using Sage for Tax Planning

**Annual Tax-Loss Harvesting Review:**

```
Hey Sage, help me plan my tax-loss harvesting for this year:

MY SITUATION:
- Capital gains realized so far: $[amount]
- Planned future sales (gains): $[amount]
- Marginal tax bracket: [%]
- Capital gains tax rate: [15% or 20%]

MY POSITIONS WITH LOSSES:
- [TICKER]: Down $[amount] (held [X] months)
- [TICKER]: Down $[amount] (held [X] months)
- [TICKER]: Down $[amount] (held [X] months)

QUESTIONS:
1. How much loss should I harvest this year?
2. Which positions should I prioritize (biggest losses? short-term vs long-term?)
3. What's my estimated tax savings?
4. Should I harvest more than I need (for future carryforward)?
5. Good replacement securities for each?
```

**Wash Sale Checker:**

```
Hey Sage, I'm planning a tax-loss harvest and want to avoid wash sales:

SALE PLAN:
- Sell [TICKER] on [date] to harvest $[amount] loss

OTHER HOLDINGS:
- I also own [list other tickers in all accounts]

QUESTIONS:
1. Do any of my other holdings qualify as "substantially identical" (wash sale risk)?
2. Do I need to sell those too, or am I safe?
3. What's a good replacement that definitely avoids wash sale?
4. Can I buy back the original after 30 days, or should I stick with replacement?
```
