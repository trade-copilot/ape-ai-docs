***

## What You'll Learn

* Why monthly reviews matter (without daily checking)
* Key metrics to track every month
* How to calculate your returns correctly
* When to rebalance (and when not to)
* How to spot problems early
* Portfolio review template you can use
* How to use Ape AI for portfolio analysis

***

## Why This Matters

**You're here because:**

* 📊 You have an active investment portfolio
* 🎯 You want to stay on track toward goals
* 🔍 You need a systematic review process
* 😰 You're unsure if you're doing well
* 📈 You want to optimize without obsessing

**The truth:** Monthly reviews keep you disciplined and informed without the anxiety of daily checking. It's the sweet spot between ignorance and obsession.

***

## Why Monthly (Not Daily or Yearly)?

### The Three Frequencies Compared

**Daily Checking:**

* ❌ Causes anxiety (60% of days are red)
* ❌ Leads to emotional decisions
* ❌ Wastes time (10-20 min/day = 60-120 hours/year)
* ❌ Short-term noise obscures long-term progress

**Monthly Checking:**

* ✅ Enough time to see meaningful trends
* ✅ Not so frequent that you panic
* ✅ Allows disciplined rebalancing
* ✅ Time-efficient (30-45 min/month = 6-9 hours/year)
* ✅ Keeps you engaged without obsessing

**Yearly Checking:**

* ❌ Too infrequent to catch problems
* ❌ Miss opportunities to rebalance
* ❌ May forget contribution schedule
* ❌ Lose touch with your investments

**Optimal: Monthly review, annual deep dive.**

***

## What to Track Every Month

### 1. Total Portfolio Value

**Current value of all holdings:**

* Brokerage account(s)
* Retirement account(s) (401k, IRA)
* Any other investment accounts

**Example tracking:**

```
January 1, 2024: $25,000
February 1, 2024: $26,200 (+4.8%)
March 1, 2024: $25,800 (-1.5%)
April 1, 2024: $27,500 (+6.6%)
```

**What you're looking for:**

* General upward trend over 6-12 months
* Don't panic about monthly dips (normal)
* Focus on 1-year rolling performance

***

### 2. Total Contributions (Money You've Added)

**Track how much you've invested:**

* Initial investment
* Plus all monthly contributions
* Minus any withdrawals

**Example:**

```
Starting (Jan 1): $20,000
+ Jan contribution: $500
+ Feb contribution: $500
+ Mar contribution: $500
Total contributed through March: $21,500
```

**Why track this:**

* Separates gains from contributions
* Shows your actual return performance
* Keeps you accountable to contribution schedule

***

### 3. Total Gains/Losses (Performance)

**Calculate your actual investment returns:**

**Formula:**

```
Total Gains = Portfolio Value - Total Contributions
```

**Example:**

```
Portfolio value (March 31): $27,500
Total contributed: $21,500
Total gains: $6,000 (+27.9% return)
```

**Month-over-month comparison:**

```
February: $5,200 gain (+24.8%)
March: $6,000 gain (+27.9%)
Improvement: +$800 (+3.1%)
```

***

### 4. Asset Allocation Drift

**Check if you're still at target allocation:**

**Target allocation (example):**

* 70% Stocks
* 20% Bonds
* 10% Cash

**Current allocation (March 31):**

```
Stocks: $20,000 (72.7%) ← Drifted +2.7%
Bonds: $5,000 (18.2%) ← Drifted -1.8%
Cash: $2,500 (9.1%) ← Drifted -0.9%
```

**Drift < 5%: No action needed** **Drift > 5%: Consider rebalancing**

***

### 5. Individual Holdings Performance

**Track each position:**

| Holding | Shares | Cost Basis | Current Value | Gain/Loss | % Return |
| ------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------- | --------- | -------- |
| VOO     | 50     | $20,000    | $22,500       | +$2,500   | +12.5%   |
| VXUS    | 60     | $6,000     | $6,300        | +$300     | +5.0%    |
| BND     | 80     | $4,000     | $3,900        | -$100     | -2.5%    |
| Apple   | 10     | $1,750     | $1,800        | +$50      | +2.9%    |

**What to look for:**

* Which holdings are outperforming? (VOO in example)
* Which are underperforming? (BND, but bonds are defensive)
* Any position down 30%+ that needs review?

***

### 6. Benchmark Comparison

**Compare your performance to market:**

**Your portfolio:** +8.5% year-to-date **S\&P 500 (VOO):** +10.2% year-to-date

**Analysis:**

* You're underperforming by 1.7%
* Reasons:
  * Bond allocation (defensive, lower returns)
  * Individual stock picks underperformed
* Is this acceptable? Yes, if your allocation is appropriate for your risk tolerance

**Don't chase returns by taking inappropriate risk.**

***

### 7. Contribution Compliance

**Did you stick to your plan?**

**Planned:** $500/month **Actual contributions:**

* January: $500 ✓
* February: $500 ✓
* March: $0 ✗ (Forgot!)

**Action:** Set up automatic contributions (if not already)

***

### 8. Dividends Received

**Track passive income:**

```
January dividends: $42
February dividends: $38
March dividends: $125 (quarterly dividends paid)
YTD total: $205
Annualized estimate: $820/year (3.0% yield on $27,500)
```

**Verify:**

* Are dividends being reinvested automatically? ✓
* Any unexpected dividend cuts? (red flag)

***

## The Monthly Review Process (Step-by-Step)

### Week 1: Gather Data (10 minutes)

**Step 1: Log portfolio values (5 min)**

* Open all brokerage accounts
* Note total value of each account
* Record in spreadsheet or notebook

**Step 2: Calculate total contributions (3 min)**

* Add this month's contribution to running total
* Verify contribution was made (if automatic)

**Step 3: Check dividends (2 min)**

* How much in dividends this month?
* Were they reinvested?

**Template:**

```
March 2024 Portfolio Snapshot

Accounts:
- Fidelity Brokerage: $27,500
- Roth IRA: $8,200
Total: $35,700

Contributions:
- Previous total: $30,000
- March contribution: $500
- New total: $30,500

Gains:
- Portfolio value: $35,700
- Contributions: $30,500
- Total gains: $5,200 (+17.0%)

Dividends this month: $125
```

***

### Week 2: Analyze Performance (15 minutes)

**Step 4: Calculate returns (5 min)**

**Month-over-month:**

* Last month: $34,800
* This month: $35,700
* Change: +$900 (+2.6%)

**Year-to-date:**

* January 1: $28,000
* March 31: $35,700
* Change: +$7,700 (+27.5%)
* BUT you contributed $2,500 YTD
* Actual gains: $5,200 (+18.6% return on capital)

**Step 5: Compare to benchmark (5 min)**

Visit Yahoo Finance, check S\&P 500 (^GSPC):

* S\&P 500 YTD: +15.2%
* Your return: +18.6%
* **You're outperforming by 3.4%!**

**Ask Money Monty:**

```
Money, my portfolio returned +18.6% YTD while S&P 500
returned +15.2%. I'm outperforming by 3.4%. Is this luck
or is my strategy working?
```

**Step 6: Review individual holdings (5 min)**

Identify:

* Best performer: VOO (+22%)
* Worst performer: BND (-2.5%)
* Any surprises: Apple only +2.9% (underperformed)

**Questions to ask:**

* Is Apple underperformance a problem? (No if short-term)
* Do I still believe in my individual stock picks?
* Should I adjust anything?

***

### Week 3: Rebalancing Check (10 minutes)

**Step 7: Calculate current allocation (5 min)**

**Target:** 70% stocks, 20% bonds, 10% cash

**Current:**

```
Stocks: $26,000 / $35,700 = 72.8%
Bonds: $6,500 / $35,700 = 18.2%
Cash: $3,200 / $35,700 = 9.0%
```

**Drift:** Stocks +2.8%, Bonds -1.8%, Cash -1.0%

**Decision:**

* Drift < 5% → No action needed (wait until >5% or annual review)
* Drift > 5% → Rebalance

**Step 8: Rebalance if needed (5 min)**

**If you needed to rebalance (this example doesn't):**

To get back to 70/20/10 on $35,700:

* Target stocks: $24,990
* Target bonds: $7,140
* Target cash: $3,570

Actions:

* Sell $1,010 of stocks
* Buy $640 of bonds
* Add $370 to cash

**Or use new contributions:**

* Next month's $500 → 100% to bonds
* Following month's $500 → 70% bonds, 30% cash
* Gradually rebalance without selling

***

### Week 4: Plan Next Month (5-10 minutes)

**Step 9: Adjust strategy if needed (5 min)**

Questions:

* Am I on track for my goals? (Use compound interest calculator)
* Should I increase monthly contributions?
* Any life changes requiring allocation shift?
* Any red flags in holdings?

**Example:** Goal is $1M by age 65 (35 years away)

* Current: $35,700
* Contributing: $500/month
* At 10% return: Will have $1,180,000 ✓ On track!

**Step 10: Set reminders and calendar (5 min)**

* Schedule next month's review (first Saturday of month)
* Set reminder to verify auto-contribution executed
* Note any upcoming actions:
  * Quarterly rebalance (if different from monthly)
  * Tax-loss harvesting window (November-December)
  * Annual review (January)

Holdings:
- $22,500 in VOO (63%)
- $6,300 in VXUS (17.7%)
- $3,900 in BND (10.9%)
- $1,800 in Apple (5%)
- $1,200 in Microsoft (3.4%)
Total: $35,700

Am I on track? Any recommendations?
```

**Money Monty will provide:**

* Allocation analysis (drift from target)
* Performance assessment
* Rebalancing recommendations
* Risk evaluation for your age
* Suggestions for improvement

***

### Individual Stock Performance Analysis

**If concerned about specific holding:**

while the S&P 500 is up 15.2%. Should I be worried?
Should I sell it?
```

Money Monty will:

* Provide context (tech sector performance, Apple-specific news)
* Evaluate fundamentals (still strong company?)
* Recommend hold/sell decision
* Explain reasoning

***

### Benchmark Comparison

```
Money, my portfolio is up 18.6% YTD while S&P 500 is up
15.2%. Why am I outperforming? Is this sustainable?
```

Money Monty will:

* Analyze your holdings vs S\&P 500
* Identify sources of outperformance
* Assess if it's skill, luck, or higher risk
* Provide realistic expectations going forward

***

## Red Flags to Watch For

### 🚩 Red Flag #1: Consistent Underperformance

**What to look for:**

* Your portfolio underperforms S\&P 500 by 5%+ for 12+ months
* Example: S\&P up 20%, you're up 10% (with similar risk)

**Possible causes:**

* Poor stock picks
* Too much in cash (drag on returns)
* High fees
* Bad timing decisions

**Action:**

* Ask Money Monty to diagnose the issue
* Consider simplifying to index funds
* Check fees (switch to lower-cost funds if high)

***

### 🚩 Red Flag #2: Not Sticking to Contribution Schedule

**What to look for:**

* Missed 2+ months of planned contributions
* Inconsistent investing

**Why it matters:**

* Dollar-cost averaging requires consistency
* Compound interest only works if you keep adding
* Discipline is #1 predictor of success

**Action:**

* Set up automatic contributions (remove human error)
* Review budget (is contribution amount too aggressive?)
* Re-commit to plan

***

### 🚩 Red Flag #3: Excessive Allocation Drift

**What to look for:**

* Allocation drifted 10%+ from target
* Example: Target 70% stocks, currently 85% stocks

**Why it matters:**

* Taking on more risk than planned
* Could get crushed in bear market
* Not maintaining discipline

**Action:**

* Rebalance immediately (sell winners, buy losers)
* Set quarterly rebalance calendar reminder

***

### 🚩 Red Flag #4: Single Stock > 20% of Portfolio

**What to look for:**

* One holding has grown to 20-30% of portfolio
* Concentration risk

**Example:**

* Apple was 5% of portfolio
* Grew to 25% due to massive gains
* Now you have concentrated risk

**Action:**

* Trim position back to 5-10% max
* Reinvest proceeds into diversified holdings
* Lock in some gains

***

### 🚩 Red Flag #5: Chasing Performance

**What to look for:**

* Selling long-term holds to buy hot stocks
* Frequent strategy changes
* Adding new holdings every month

**Example:**

* Sold VOO to buy AI stocks after they surged 50%
* Bought crypto after it doubled
* Constantly chasing last year's winners

**Action:**

* Return to investment policy statement
* Stick to original strategy
* Remember: Past performance ≠ future results
