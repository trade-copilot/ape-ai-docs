## What are Earnings Reports?

### The Basics

**Earnings reports** are quarterly financial updates that public companies are required to file with the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission).

**Two types:**

**1. Quarterly Reports (Form 10-Q)**
- Filed every 3 months (Q1, Q2, Q3)
- ~20-50 pages
- Not fully audited
- Quick snapshot of quarterly performance

**2. Annual Reports (Form 10-K)**
- Filed once per year (after Q4)
- ~100-300 pages
- Fully audited
- Comprehensive view of entire year + business description

**When are they released?**
- Companies have 45 days after quarter-end to file 10-Q
- Companies have 90 days after year-end to file 10-K
- Most companies release within 30-60 days

**Earnings season:** 4-6 week period when most companies report
- Jan-Feb (Q4/annual results)
- Apr-May (Q1 results)
- Jul-Aug (Q2 results)
- Oct-Nov (Q3 results)

## Why Read Earnings Reports?

### Reason #1: Get the Truth (Not the Hype)

**News headlines:**
- "Apple beats earnings expectations!"
- "Amazon misses revenue targets!"

**Reality:**
- Headlines are oversimplified
- Missing context and nuance
- Often focusing on one metric

**Earnings reports give you:**
- Complete financial picture
- Context behind the numbers
- Management's explanation
- Forward-looking guidance

**Example:**

**Headline:** "Tesla misses earnings by 10%!"

**After reading 10-Q:**
- Miss was due to one-time factory shutdown (temporary)
- Revenue still up 40% year-over-year
- Gross margins improving (positive trend)
- Guidance raised for next quarter

**Decision:** Bad headline, but good fundamentals → Still bullish

---

### Reason #2: Spot Red Flags Early

**Before the stock crashes:**

**Example: Enron (2000-2001)**
- Reported strong earnings
- Stock at all-time highs
- **But:** 10-K showed massive off-balance-sheet debt
- **Result:** Investors who read it sold early, avoided 99% loss

**Example: General Electric (2017-2018)**
- Reported "adjusted" earnings (looked good)
- **But:** 10-K showed deteriorating cash flow
- **Red flag:** "Adjusted earnings" ≠ actual cash
- **Result:** Stock crashed 60% over next year

**Reading earnings = early warning system**

---

### Reason #3: Find Hidden Opportunities

**Undervalued companies that the market is ignoring:**

**Example:** Small-cap company with:
- Boring industry (nobody pays attention)
- Growing revenue 25%/year (10-K shows it)
- Expanding profit margins (getting more efficient)
- Trading at P/E of 12 (cheap!)

**Market hasn't noticed yet.** You reading the 10-K gives you an edge.

---

## The Three Financial Statements

### 1. Income Statement (P&L - Profit & Loss)

**What it shows:** How much money did the company make (or lose)?

**Key lines:**

**Revenue / Sales**
- Total money from selling products/services
- **Look for:** Growing revenue year-over-year (YoY)

**Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**
- Direct costs to produce products
- **Look for:** COGS growing slower than revenue (good!)

**Gross Profit**
- Revenue - COGS
- **Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Revenue**
- **Look for:** Margins improving over time

**Operating Expenses**
- Sales & marketing, R&D, general & administrative (G&A)
- **Look for:** These growing slower than revenue

**Operating Income**
- Gross Profit - Operating Expenses
- **Operating Margin = Operating Income / Revenue**
- **Look for:** Positive and growing

**Net Income**
- The bottom line (after taxes, interest, etc.)
- **Net Profit Margin = Net Income / Revenue**
- **Look for:** Positive and growing

**Example: Apple Q1 2024 Income Statement (Simplified)**

```
Revenue:                   $119.6 billion
Cost of Goods Sold:        $68.3 billion
--------------------------------
Gross Profit:              $51.3 billion (42.9% margin)

Operating Expenses:        $14.8 billion
--------------------------------
Operating Income:          $36.5 billion (30.5% margin)

Taxes:                     $6.1 billion
Interest/Other:            $0.3 billion
--------------------------------
Net Income:                $30.1 billion (25.2% margin)
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Revenue up 2% YoY (steady growth)
- ✅ Gross margin 42.9% (strong pricing power)
- ✅ Operating margin 30.5% (efficient operations)
- ✅ Net margin 25.2% (highly profitable)

---

### 2. Balance Sheet

**What it shows:** What does the company own (assets) vs. owe (liabilities)?

**Key sections:**

**ASSETS (What the company owns):**

**Current Assets:**
- Cash & equivalents
- Accounts receivable (money owed by customers)
- Inventory

**Long-Term Assets:**
- Property, plant, equipment (PP&E)
- Intangible assets (patents, trademarks)
- Investments

**LIABILITIES (What the company owes):**

**Current Liabilities:**
- Accounts payable (money owed to suppliers)
- Short-term debt

**Long-Term Liabilities:**
- Long-term debt
- Deferred revenue
- Pension obligations

**EQUITY (Shareholders' value):**
- Common stock
- Retained earnings
- **Equity = Assets - Liabilities**

**Example: Microsoft Balance Sheet (Simplified)**

```
ASSETS:
  Cash:                    $111 billion
  Accounts Receivable:     $48 billion
  Inventory:               $3 billion
  PP&E:                    $95 billion
  Goodwill/Intangibles:    $180 billion
  --------------------------------
  Total Assets:            $512 billion

LIABILITIES:
  Accounts Payable:        $25 billion
  Short-term Debt:         $9 billion
  Long-term Debt:          $58 billion
  Other Liabilities:       $110 billion
  --------------------------------
  Total Liabilities:       $202 billion

EQUITY:                    $310 billion
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ $111B cash (strong liquidity)
- ✅ Debt: $67B total ($58B long-term + $9B short-term)
- ✅ Debt-to-Equity: $67B / $310B = 0.22 (very low, safe)
- ✅ Current Ratio: Current Assets / Current Liabilities = 2.5× (healthy)

**Key Metrics to Calculate:**

**Debt-to-Equity Ratio:**
```
= Total Debt / Total Equity
< 0.5 = Very safe
0.5-1.0 = Moderate
> 2.0 = Risky
```

**Current Ratio:**
```
= Current Assets / Current Liabilities
> 2.0 = Very healthy
1.0-2.0 = Adequate
< 1.0 = Liquidity concerns
```

---

### 3. Cash Flow Statement

**What it shows:** How much actual CASH did the company generate?

**Why it matters:**
- Companies can manipulate earnings (accounting tricks)
- Cash is harder to fake
- Cash is what pays dividends, debt, and funds growth

**Three sections:**

**Operating Cash Flow:**
- Cash from core business operations
- **Look for:** Positive and growing
- **Should be > Net Income** (high quality earnings)

**Investing Cash Flow:**
- Cash spent on growth (buying assets, R&D, acquisitions)
- **Usually negative** (companies investing for future)

**Financing Cash Flow:**
- Cash from/to investors (debt, equity, dividends, buybacks)
- Negative = paying dividends/buybacks (good!)
- Positive = raising debt/equity (need cash, could be concerning)

**Example: Amazon Cash Flow (Simplified)**

```
Operating Cash Flow:       $84 billion (from operations)
Investing Cash Flow:       -$59 billion (buying warehouses, tech)
Financing Cash Flow:       -$18 billion (paying debt)
--------------------------------
Net Change in Cash:        +$7 billion
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ $84B operating cash flow (strong core business)
- ✅ Investing heavily ($59B) in growth
- ✅ Paying down debt ($18B) - financially prudent
- ✅ Net cash increased (healthy)

**Key Metric:**

**Free Cash Flow (FCF):**
```
= Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures
= Cash available after maintaining/growing business
```

**Example:**
- Operating Cash Flow: $84B
- CapEx (from investing section): $55B
- **Free Cash Flow: $84B - $55B = $29B**

**FCF is what the company can:**
- Pay dividends
- Buy back stock
- Pay down debt
- Acquire other companies
- Save for rainy day

**Look for:** FCF growing over time

## Listening to Earnings Calls

---

### How to Listen Effectively

**The 2-Part Structure:**

- CFO walks through financial results
- Management provides guidance

**What to listen for:**
- Tone (confident vs. defensive)
- Focus areas (what they emphasize)
- Buzzwords to avoid complexity

**Part 2: Q&A (30-40 min)**

---

### Red Flags in Earnings Calls

**❌ Management is evasive:**

- "We'll get back to you on that"
- "I can't comment on that at this time"

**❌ Management blames externalities:**

- "Adjusted EBITDA" (excluding 'one-time' costs)
- "Non-GAAP earnings" (excluding stock-based comp)

**Red flag if:** Non-GAAP earnings >> GAAP earnings (hiding losses)

**❌ CFO does most of the talking:**
- CEO should lead on business strategy

---

**Step 2: Check Management Commentary (MD&A)**

**What management said:**
- iPhone revenue flat due to difficult YoY comp (Q1 2023 was huge)
- Services growing strongly (recurring revenue)
- Wearables (Apple Watch, AirPods) growing steadily
- Mac/iPad weak due to tough macro for consumer electronics

**Guidance:**
- Expect "low single-digit" revenue growth next quarter
- Services to continue growing double-digits

---

**Step 3: Listen to Earnings Call**

**CEO Tim Cook:**
- Highlighted installed base of 2.2 billion devices (all-time high)
- Vision Pro (new product) launching soon
- Confident in long-term growth

**CFO Luca Maestri:**
- Margins pressured by currency headwinds (strong dollar)
- Expect margins to improve as currency stabilizes

**Q&A:**

**Positives:**

- ✅ Services growing 11% (high-margin, recurring)
- ✅ Installed base at all-time high (future services growth)
- ✅ Massive buyback ($90B)
- ✅ Net cash position ($55B)

**Negatives:**
- ❌ iPhone revenue flat (core product stalling)
- ❌ Mac/iPad down significantly (weak consumer demand)
- ❌ Margins compressing slightly
- ❌ China weakness (geopolitical risk)

**Investment Decision:**
- **Hold/Buy on dips**
- Core business stable (not declining)
- Services growth offsets hardware weakness
- Strong capital returns (buybacks)
- Valuation reasonable (P/E ~28, not cheap but not expensive)

**Risks to monitor:**
- iPhone cycle (when does next super-cycle happen?)
- China regulatory/competition risks
- Margin compression if continues
