* ✅ Make mistakes and learn from them
* ✅ Build muscle memory for order entry
* ✅ Develop emotional discipline
* ✅ Track performance over time

### Who Should Paper Trade?

**Mandatory for:**

* Complete options beginners
* Anyone who hasn't traded stocks before
* People unfamiliar with order types
* Those unsure about risk tolerance

**Recommended for:**

* Stock traders new to options
* Testing new options strategies
* Learning a new platform
* Recovering from losing streak

**💡 Industry Standard:** Professional traders paper trade new strategies for 3-6 months before risking real capital.

## Before You Start

### Prerequisites

✅ **Account Setup**

* Ape AI account created
* Comfortable navigating the app
* Basic understanding of options (calls/puts)

✅ **Knowledge Requirements**

* Read [First Options Trade →](first-options-trade/) guide
* Understand what calls and puts are
* Know basic options terminology
* Comfortable with risk of 100% loss

✅ **Mindset**

* Treat paper money like real money
* Take it seriously (no YOLO trades)
* Track and analyze every trade
* Focus on process, not just profits

### What You Need

* 30-60 minutes for initial setup
* Commitment to 20+ paper trades before going live
* Discipline to follow your trading plan
* Willingness to learn from losses

***

## Step 1: Set Up Paper Trading Account

### Enable Paper Trading

**On Web:**

1. Go to **Settings** (gear icon)
2. Navigate to **Paper Trading** section
3. Toggle **"Enable Paper Trading"**
4. Set starting balance (recommended: $10,000)
5. Confirm activation

**On iOS:**

1. Tap **Profile** icon (bottom right)
2. Tap **Settings**
3. Scroll to **Paper Trading**

6. Confirm activation

### Starting Balance Recommendation

**$10,000 is ideal because:**

* Realistic for many traders
* Enough for proper position sizing
* Not so large you ignore risk management
* Allows for multiple positions

**Don't start with $100k+ paper money:**

* Unrealistic for most traders
* Encourages bad habits
* Won't translate to real trading
* Makes risk management meaningless

### Verify Paper Trading is Active

**Check for indicators:**

* 🟢 Green "PAPER" badge in top corner
* Paper balance displayed in portfolio
* "Paper Trading Mode" shown in settings
* All trades marked as paper trades

**⚠️ Important:** Always verify you're in paper mode before placing trades! Double-check the indicator.

## Common Paper Trading Mistakes

### ❌ Don't Do This

**1. Not taking it seriously**

* "It's fake money, who cares"
* Making YOLO trades
* Ignoring risk management
* No journaling

**Why it matters:**

* You learn bad habits
* Won't translate to real trading
* Wasted opportunity
* False confidence

**2. Using unrealistic capital**

* Starting with $100k+ paper money
* Position sizing too large
* Trading 10+ contracts per trade
* Ignoring account size

**Why it matters:**

* Won't have that capital in real life
* Risk management meaningless
* Can't replicate with real money
* Builds unrealistic expectations

**3. Overtrading**

* 5+ trades per day
* Not waiting for setups
* Trading out of boredom
* Chasing every move

**Why it matters:**

* Quality > Quantity
* Best traders are selective
* Overtrading = commissions/slippage
* Exhausting with real money

**4. Ignoring fees and slippage**

* Paper trading often has perfect fills
* No commission costs
* No bid/ask spread
* Instant executions

**Why it matters:**

* Real trading has friction
* $1-5 per contract in fees
* Slippage on large orders
* Options can be illiquid

**5. Not journaling losses**

* Only recording winning trades
* Ignoring what went wrong
* Not analyzing mistakes
* Cherry-picking results

**Why it matters:**

* Learn more from losses than wins
* Patterns repeat
* Need to fix leaks
* Self-deception hurts

**6. Switching strategies too quickly**

* Try calls for 2 trades → puts
* Try weekly options → monthly
* No consistency
