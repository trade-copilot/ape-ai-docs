## 🚀 The Complete Swing Trading Workflow

### Step 1: Weekend Research (Sunday Evening)

**Best time for swing trading research: Sunday 6-8 PM**

**Open Chat and ask:**
> "What are the best swing trade setups for this week?"

**AI Response Example (Maverick Persona):**
> "Top 3 swing setups for the week:
>
> **1. NVDA - AI Momentum Play**
> - Current: $875
> - Setup: Breaking out of consolidation
> - Target: $920-950 (5-9% gain)
> - Timeframe: 3-7 days
> - Entry: $870-880
> - Stop: $850
>
> **2. TSLA - Delivery Beat Setup**
> - Current: $465
> - Setup: Earnings catalyst + technical breakout
> - Target: $495-510 (6-10% gain)
> - Timeframe: 5-10 days
> - Entry: $460-470
> - Stop: $445
>
> **3. AMD - Analyst Upgrade**
> - Current: $175
> - Setup: Fresh catalyst + support hold
> - Target: $190-195 (8-11% gain)
> - Timeframe: 7-14 days
> - Entry: $172-178
> - Stop: $165
>
> **My pick:** NVDA has the cleanest setup. Waiting for dip to $875 for entry."

**Screenshot this for the week ahead.**

---

### Step 2: Find Entry Point (Monday-Tuesday)

**Don't rush the entry!** Swing trades require patience.

**Monitor your target stock (NVDA) and ask AI:**
> "Is NVDA at a good swing entry now?"

**Monday 10 AM - AI Response:**
> "NVDA at $882 - slightly above ideal entry ($870-880). I'd wait for a pullback to $875-878 for better R/R."

**Tuesday 11 AM - Check again:**
> "Is NVDA at a good swing entry now?"

**AI Response:**
> "NVDA at $876 - YES, this is a good entry!
>
> **Swing Trade Setup:**
> - Entry: $876 (within $870-880 range)
> - Target: $920 (5% gain)
> - Stop: $850 (3% loss)
> - Risk/Reward: 1.7:1
> - Hold time: 3-7 days
>
> **Why now:**
> - Pulled back to support
> - RSI cooled to 58 (was overbought)
> - Volume picking up
> - Market structure intact
>
> Ready to execute?"

---

### Step 3: Execute the Trade (Shares or Options)

**You'll see "Execute Trade" button below AI's recommendation.**

#### **Option A: Swing Trade with Shares** (Lower Risk, Easier Management)

**📱 iOS - Execute:**
1. **Tap "Execute Trade"**
2. **Review Order:**
   - Ticker: NVDA
   - Action: Buy
   - Quantity: 10 shares (adjust to your size)
   - Price: $876 limit
   - Est. Cost: $8,760

3. **Adjust Quantity:**
   - $1K account: 1 share
   - $5K account: 5 shares
   - $10K account: 10 shares
   - Never risk more than 10-20% of account on one trade

4. **Place Order** → Authenticate
5. **Filled!** ✅

**🌐 Web - Same process, just click instead of tap**

---

#### **Option B: Swing Trade with Options** (Higher Risk, Bigger Gains)

**Ask AI for options setup:**
> "Give me a swing trade options setup for NVDA"

**AI Response:**
> "NVDA Swing Options Setup:
>
> **Buy:** NVDA $880 calls
> **Expiration:** 2-3 weeks out (Dec 1)
> **Entry:** $18-20 per contract
> **Target:** $28-32 (40-60% gain if NVDA hits $920)
> **Stop:** $14 (30% loss if NVDA drops to $860)
>
> **Pros:** Leverage - control 100 shares for $1,800
> **Cons:** Theta decay - loses value over time"

**Execute:**
1. **Tap/Click "Execute Trade"**
2. **Review:**
   - NVDA $880 calls, exp 12/1
   - Entry: $19.00 limit
   - Quantity: 1 contract
   - Cost: $1,900

3. **Place Order** → Authenticate
4. **Filled!** ✅

**For beginners:** Start with shares, not options. Options add complexity and time decay.

---

### Step 4: Set Price Alerts (Not Stop Loss)

**Swing trades are different from day trades:**
- Don't set tight stop losses (noise will stop you out)
- Use price alerts instead
- Give the trade room to breathe

**Set Alerts:**

**📱 iOS:**
1. Go to **Portfolio**
2. Find **NVDA** position
3. Tap **"Set Alert"**
4. **Alert 1:** $850 (stop level - warning)
5. **Alert 2:** $920 (target - time to sell)

**🌐 Web:**
1. Go to **Portfolio**
2. Click **NVDA** position
3. Set **Price Alerts:**
   - Low: $850
   - High: $920

**Why alerts not stops?**
- Swing trades fluctuate daily
- $850 is "consider exiting" not "auto-sell"
- You'll make decision when alert hits

---

### Step 5: Daily Monitoring (5-10 Minutes)

**Every Morning (9:45 AM) and Evening (4:15 PM):**

**Ask AI:**
> "How's my NVDA swing trade looking?"

**Day 1 (Entry Day) - Evening Update:**
> "NVDA Update:
> - Current: $878 (+0.2% from entry)
> - Status: Consolidating, normal
> - Target: $920 (4.8% away)
> - Stop: $850 (3.2% away)
> - Hold: Yes, give it time"

**Day 2 - Morning Update:**
> "NVDA Update:
> - Current: $885 (+1% from entry)
> - Status: Grinding higher
> - Next resistance: $895
> - Hold: Yes, momentum building"

**Day 3 - Evening Update:**
> "NVDA Update:
> - Current: $895 (+2.2% from entry)
> - Status: Breaking resistance
> - Approaching target: $920 (2.8% away)
> - Hold: Yes, target in sight"

**No action needed** - just check and track. Patience is key!

---

### Step 6: Take Profits (Hit Target)

**Day 5 - Alert Goes Off!**

**Your phone buzzes:** "NVDA reached $920"

**Ask AI:**
> "NVDA hit my target at $920. Should I sell?"

**AI Response:**
> "NVDA hit target! Recommendation:
>
> **Sell 75%** at $920 (lock in +5% gain)
> **Hold 25%** with trailing stop at $910
>
> Why:
> - Target achieved
> - May run to $935, but secure profits first
> - Trailing stop protects remaining position"

**Execute Exit (Full Position):**

1. Go to **Chat**
2. Say: **"Sell my NVDA shares"** or **"Sell my NVDA calls"**
3. **"Execute Trade"** button appears
4. **Review:**
   - Action: Sell
   - Quantity: 10 shares (or 75% if doing partial)
   - Price: $920 limit

5. **Place Order** → Authenticate
6. **Sold!** ✅

**Results:**
- Entry: $876 x 10 shares = $8,760
- Exit: $920 x 10 shares = $9,200
- Profit: $440 (5% gain)
- Hold time: 5 days

---

### Step 7: Alternative Exits

#### **Exit A: Partial Profits (Intermediate Strategy)**

**When target hit:**
- Sell 50-75% of position
- Let remaining run with trailing stop
- Maximize upside while securing gains

**Chat command:**
> "Sell 7 of my 10 NVDA shares at $920"

**Execute** → Keep 3 shares with $910 trailing stop

---

#### **Exit B: Stop Loss Triggered**

**If NVDA drops to $850 (your alert level):**

**Ask AI:**
> "NVDA hit $850, my stop alert. Should I sell?"

**AI Response:**
> "NVDA broke $850 support. Recommendation: Exit now.
>
> - Setup failed
> - Cut loss at -3%
> - Move on to next setup"

**Execute Exit:**
> "Sell my NVDA shares"

**Result:**
- Entry: $876
- Exit: $850
- Loss: -$260 (-3%)
- **This is okay!** Small loss, preserved capital.

---

#### **Exit C: Scaling Out (Advanced)**

**As NVDA climbs toward target:**

**At $900 (+2.7%):**
> "Sell 3 NVDA shares" (30% of position)
> Profit locked: $72

**At $915 (+4.5%):**
> "Sell 3 more NVDA shares" (30% of position)
> Profit locked: $117

**At $925 (+5.6%):**
> "Sell remaining 4 NVDA shares" (40% of position)
> Final profit: $196

**Total profit: $385** (4.4% average)

**Benefit:** Reduces risk as trade moves in your favor

## 💡 Swing Trading Pro Tips

### 1. Entry Patience is Key
**Don't chase:**
- AI says entry $870-880
- Stock at $890? **Wait!**
- It will pull back

**Use limit orders:**
- Place order at ideal price
- Walk away
- Let market come to you

---

### 2. Give Trades Time to Work
**Swing trades aren't day trades:**
- Don't panic on Day 1 red
- Give it 3-5 days minimum
- Check 2x daily, not 20x

---

### 3. Position Sizing for Swings
**Recommended:**
- 10-20% of account per swing trade
- Run 2-3 positions simultaneously
- Never more than 50% deployed

**Example with $10K account:**
- Position 1: NVDA $2,000 (20%)
- Position 2: TSLA $1,500 (15%)
- Position 3: AMD $1,500 (15%)
- Cash: $5,000 (50%)

---

### 4. Use Shares for First 10 Swings
**Why shares over options:**
- No time decay
- Less stress
- Easier to hold multi-day
- Still get 5-15% gains

**Graduate to options** after mastering share swings

---

### 5. Weekend Research Routine
**Every Sunday:**
- Ask AI for week's setups
- Screen shot top 3
- Set price alerts
- Know your plan before Monday

**Preparation = Better entries**

## ⚠️ Common Swing Trading Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Checking Too Often
**Problem:** Checking position every hour
**Result:** Emotional decisions, early exits
**Solution:** Check 2x daily max (morning + evening)

---

### Mistake 2: Taking Profits Too Early
**Problem:** Stock up 2%, you sell (target was 5%)
**Result:** Miss bigger gains
**Solution:** Trust AI's target, be patient

---

### Mistake 3: Not Cutting Losses
**Problem:** Down 5%, hoping it bounces
**Result:** Small loss becomes big loss
**Solution:** Follow stop loss alert

---

### Mistake 4: Holding Too Long
**Problem:** Hit target, you get greedy
**Result:** Give back gains
**Solution:** Sell at least 50-75% at target

---

### Mistake 5: Too Many Positions
**Problem:** 5-6 swing trades at once
**Result:** Can't monitor, poor execution
**Solution:** Max 3 positions for beginners

---

## 🚧 Troubleshooting

### Position Not Moving After 3 Days

**Ask AI:**
> "My NVDA swing isn't moving. Should I hold or exit?"

**AI assesses:**
- Is setup still intact?
- Has catalyst happened?
- Is stop still safe?
- Recommendation: Hold, exit, or adjust

---

### Hit Stop Loss Early

**Don't feel bad:**
- 30-40% of swing trades fail
- Small losses are part of process
- Move to next setup
- AI will give new ideas

---

### Target Seems Too Far

**Example:** Entry $876, target $920, but stuck at $885

**Ask AI:**
> "NVDA stuck at $885. Adjust target?"

**AI may say:**
- Hold: Target still achievable
- Or: Take profits at $895, close enough

---

## 🎓 Advanced Swing Techniques

### Technique 1: Scaling In
**Instead of full position at once:**
- Buy 1/3 at $876
- Buy 1/3 if dips to $870
- Buy 1/3 if breaks $885

**Lower average cost, better R/R**

---

### Technique 2: Trailing Stops
**After target hit:**
- Sell 75%
- Set trailing stop on 25%
- Example: $920 entry, trail at $910
- If runs to $935, stop moves to $925
- Capture extended moves

---

### Technique 3: Weekly Options for Swings
**2-4 week options instead of shares:**
- More leverage
- Still enough time (avoid theta crush)
- 20-50% gains vs 5-10% on shares

**Ask AI:**
> "Give me a 3-week options swing setup for NVDA"

---
