## 🚀 Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Find a Day Trade Setup (5 min)

**Go to Chat, use Quick Prompt:**
Tap **"Day Trade Options Setup"** or ask:
> "Find me a day trade stock setup right now"

**AI might respond:**
> "TSLA day trade setup:
> - Entry: $465-467
> - Target: $472 (+1.5%)
> - Stop loss: $462 (-0.6%)
> - Volume strong, breaking resistance
> - Risk/reward: 2.5:1"

---

### Step 2: Research the Stock (2 min)

**Tap TSLA to open ticker page:**
- Check Snapshot Grades (want Technical A or B)
- Check current price
- Confirm volume is high
- Check news (any catalyst?)

**If grades look good → Continue**
**If Technical grade D or F → Skip, ask AI for another setup**

---

### Step 3: Plan Your Trade (3 min)

**Write down (or mentally note):**
- Entry price: $465-467
- Target price: $472
- Stop loss: $462
- Position size: Start small! (100 shares paper, or 10-20 shares real)
- Max loss if stopped: ~$50 (manageable)

**Risk only 1-2% of your account on first trades!**

---

### Step 4: Execute Entry (2 min)

**When price hits your entry zone ($465-467):**

**Option A: From Chat**
- Tap **"Execute Trade"** button (if AI gave you a setup)
- Review order: Buy 100 shares TSLA, Limit $466
- Confirm

**Option B: From Ticker Page**
- Ticker page → Trade button
- Buy 100 shares, Limit $466
- Confirm

**Order placed! ✅**

---

### Step 5: Set Stop Loss Immediately (1 min)

**As soon as you're filled:**

1. Go to Portfolio tab
2. Find your TSLA position
3. Set stop loss order: Sell 100 shares at $462
4. Confirm

**This protects you if trade goes wrong!**

**Never skip this step.**

---

### Step 6: Monitor Position (Variable)

**Now you wait and watch:**

**If stock moves toward target ($472):**
- ✅ Great! Be patient
- Don't get greedy, stick to plan

**If stock moves toward stop ($462):**
- ⚠️ Prepare to exit
- Stop loss will trigger automatically

**If stock just chops around $465-467:**
- 😐 Normal, give it time
- If no movement after 1-2 hours, consider exiting break-even

**Check every 15-30 minutes**, not every minute (avoid stress)

---

### Step 7: Take Profits at Target (2 min)

**Stock hits $472! Target reached!**

**Execute exit:**
1. Portfolio → Tap TSLA position
2. Sell 100 shares, Market order (or Limit $472)
3. Confirm
4. Cancel your stop loss order (no longer needed)

**Trade closed! ✅**

**Profit:** Bought at $466, sold at $472 = +$600 on 100 shares! (+1.3%)

---

### Step 8: Review Your Trade (5 min)

**Win or lose, always review:**

**Questions to ask:**
1. Did I follow my plan? (entry, target, stop)
2. Was my entry price good?
3. Did I exit too early/late?
4. What could I improve?
5. Was position size appropriate?

**Write notes** (journal):
> "TSLA day trade +$600. Setup was solid, entry good, took profits at target. Could have held for $474 but sticking to plan is more important. Good trade."

**Learning from every trade = getting better**
