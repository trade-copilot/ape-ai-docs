## Step 1: Review Previous Week (30-45 min)

### Performance Analysis

**Open your trading journal:**

**Calculate key metrics:**

```
Week Performance Report
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Trades Taken: 6
Winners: 4 (66.7%)
Losers: 2 (33.3%)

Average Win: +3.2%
Average Loss: -1.8%
Net P&L: +$1,450 (+2.9%)

Best Trade: NVDA +5.8%
Worst Trade: TSLA -2.4%

Largest Position: 2.5% risk
Total Max Risk: 6.2%
```

**Ask yourself:**

* What was my win rate this week?
* Did I follow my trading plan?
* Were my stops too tight/wide?
* Did I take profits too early/late?
* Any emotional mistakes?

### Trade-by-Trade Review

**For each trade, analyze:**

**Trade #1: NVDA (Winner +5.8%)**

```
Entry: $495
Exit: $524
Hold time: 4 days

What went right:
✓ Entered on breakout (good timing)
✓ Volume confirmed move
✓ Held through small pullback (discipline)
✓ Took profit at target

What could improve:
- Could've sized larger (only 1.5% risk)
- Partial profit at 50% gain would've locked gains

Lesson: Trust the setup, scale into winners
```

**Trade #2: TSLA (Loser -2.4%)**

```
Entry: $242
Exit: $236 (stop hit)
Hold time: 2 days

What went wrong:
✗ Entry was too early (no breakout)
✗ Ignored weak volume
✗ Thesis: "Elon tweeted" (not enough)

What to improve:
- Wait for actual breakout, not anticipation
- Require volume confirmation
- Better thesis required

Lesson: Don't jump the gun, be patient
```

### Ask Sage for Weekly Analysis

```

```
NVDA Valuation Assessment

Current Price: $730
P/E Ratio: 68
Sector Avg P/E: 28

Analysis:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
NVDA trading at 2.4x sector average.

Premium justified by:
✓ 200%+ revenue growth
✓ AI chip near-monopoly
✓ Explosive margin expansion
✓ 10+ year runway

PEG Ratio: 0.34
(P/E 68 ÷ Growth 200% = 0.34)

Fair Value Estimate: $700-800
Current: $730 (within range)

Recommendation:
Not overvalued despite high P/E.
Quality premium justified.
