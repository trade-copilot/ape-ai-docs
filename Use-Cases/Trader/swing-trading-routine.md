## Step 2: Market Open Routine (9:30-10:00am)

### The First 30 Minutes

**9:30-9:35am: Observe**

- Follow your pre-market plan
- No impulsive changes

**9:45-10:00am: Confirm & Set Alerts**
- Set stops on new positions
- Set price alerts for watchlist
- Final check on existing positions
- Then STEP AWAY

### Executing Your Planned Entries

**From Maverick's setup:**

1. MSFT breaks $387 → Execute
2. Tap **"Execute trade"** on setup card
3. Verify order details
4. Confirm purchase

## Step 4: Market Close Routine (3:45-4:15pm)

**15 minutes before close (3:45pm):**

**Check:**

## Risk Management for Swing Traders

### Position Sizing Formula

**Calculate risk per trade:**

```
Account size: $50,000
Risk per trade: 1.5%
Max risk: $750

Stock: AAPL
Entry: $175
Stop: $172
Risk per share: $3

Position size: $750 ÷ $3 = 250 shares
Total capital: 250 × $175 = $43,750

Position as % of account: 87.5%
Risk as % of account: 1.5% ✓
```

**Position sizing rules:**
- Risk 1-2% of account per trade
- Max 3-5 positions at once
- Never more than 10% total risk
- Reduce size if uncertain

### Stop Loss Strategy

**Types of stops:**

**1. Technical Stop**
- Below support level
- Below key moving average
- Below recent swing low

**2. Percentage Stop**
- 2-3% from entry (tight)
- 5-7% from entry (normal)
- 8-10% from entry (wide)

**3. Time Stop**
- Exit if no progress in 3-5 days
- Setup invalidated by time
- Capital better used elsewhere

**4. Trailing Stop**
- Trail by 50% of gain
- Or trail under each higher low
- Locks in profits

### Portfolio Heat Management

**Track total exposure:**

```
Current Positions:
1. AAPL: 1.5% risk
2. MSFT: 1.2% risk
3. NVDA: 1.8% risk

Total portfolio risk: 4.5%

Maximum allowed: 5%
Remaining capacity: 0.5%

Action: Can add 1 small position only
```

**Don't exceed:**

**Remember:** Swing trading is about consistency, not perfection. You don't need to catch every move. Focus on high-probability setups, manage risk religiously, and let the edge play out over time. 📈

**The best swing traders are boringly consistent. Build the routine, trust the process, stick to the plan.**
