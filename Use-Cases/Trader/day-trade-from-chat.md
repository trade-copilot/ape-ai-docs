## 🚀 The Complete Day Trading Workflow

### Step 1: Pre-Market Prep (9:00 AM - 9:25 AM)

**Open Ape AI and navigate to Chat.**

**Ask AI for pre-market movers:**
> "What stocks are gapping up pre-market with volume?"

**AI Response Example:**
> "Pre-market movers with volume:
> 1. **TSLA** +3.2% on delivery numbers (volume: 5.2M)
> 2. **NVDA** -2.1% on profit-taking (volume: 3.8M)
> 3. **AMD** +4.8% on analyst upgrade (volume: 6.1M)
>
> AMD has the cleanest setup - breaking above $175 resistance with strong volume."

**Pro tip:** Screenshot or note the tickers AI recommends for later.

### Step 2: Find Specific Trade Setup (9:25 AM - 9:30 AM)

**Use Quick Prompt: "Day Trade Options Setup"**

---

### Step 3: Execute the Trade (9:30 AM - Market Open)

   - Ticker: AMD
   - Action: Buy to Open
   - Type: Call
   - Strike: $180
   - Expiration: 11/8
   - Quantity: 1 contract
   - Price: $3.60 (limit)

---

### Step 4: Set Stop Loss Immediately (9:31 AM)

**This is crucial - don't skip!**

**Go to Portfolio Tab:**

**📱 iOS:**
1. Tap **Portfolio** (bottom navigation)
2. Find **AMD $180 call** position
3. Tap the position
4. Tap **"Set Alert"** or **"Set Stop Loss"**
5. Enter **$2.80** (AI's recommended stop)
6. Save

**🌐 Web:**
1. Click **Portfolio** (left sidebar)
2. Find **AMD $180 call** position
3. Click **"Manage Position"**
4. Set **Stop Loss: $2.80**
5. Save

**Why this matters:** Stop loss protects you from big losses if trade goes wrong.

---

### Step 5: Monitor Position (9:30 AM - 12:00 PM)

**Keep an eye on your trade:**

**Check every 30-60 minutes:**
- Current option price
- Underlying stock (AMD) price
- Is it approaching target ($5.00)?
- Is it approaching stop ($2.80)?

**Use AI for updates:**
> "How's my AMD call looking?"

**AI Response Example:**
> "AMD $180 call update:
> - Current: $4.20 (up 17% from entry)
> - AMD stock: $180.50 (holding above $180)
> - Target: $5.00 (still achievable)
> - Stop: $2.80 (safe distance)
>
> Recommendation: Hold. AMD showing strength. Consider taking partial profits at $4.50."

---

### Step 6: Take Profits (Exit Strategy)

**Option A: Hit Target ($5.00)**

If AMD call reaches $5.00:

**Ask AI:**
> "Should I close my AMD call at $5.00?"

**AI Response:**
> "AMD hitting target. Take profits now."

**Execute Exit:**
1. Go to **Chat**
2. Say: **"Sell my AMD call"**
3. **"Execute Trade"** button appears
4. Review: **Sell to Close, Limit $5.00**
5. **Place Order** → Authenticate
6. **Sold!** ✅

**Result:**
- Entry: $3.60
- Exit: $5.00
- Profit: $140 per contract (39% gain)
- Time held: ~2 hours

---

**Option B: Partial Profits ($4.50)**

If AMD call reaches $4.50 mid-day:

**Ask AI:**
> "Should I take profits on my AMD call at $4.50?"

**AI:**
> "AMD consolidating at $181. Consider taking 50% off at $4.50, let rest run to $5.00."

**Execute Partial Exit:**
1. If you have 2 contracts: Sell 1
2. If you have 1 contract: Decide to sell all or hold
3. Use chat: **"Sell 1 AMD $180 call"**
4. Execute → Profit locked: $90 (25% gain)
5. Keep 1 contract running for target

---

**Option C: Stop Loss Hit ($2.80)**

If trade goes against you:

**Your stop loss triggers automatically** (if you set one at brokerage level)

OR

**If manual stop:**

**Watch for stop:**
- AMD call drops to $2.80
- AI alerts you: "AMD call hitting stop loss level"

**Execute Exit:**
1. Chat: **"Sell my AMD call"**
2. Execute: **Sell to Close at market or $2.80 limit**
3. **Cut loss:** -$80 (22% loss)

**Why this is okay:** Small loss is better than big loss. Move on to next trade.

---

### Step 7: Post-Trade Review (After Exit)

**Ask AI for trade review:**
> "Review my AMD call trade"

**AI Response Example:**
> "Trade review: AMD $180 call
>
> **Entry:** $3.60 @ 9:31 AM
> **Exit:** $5.00 @ 11:45 AM
> **Result:** +$140 (39% gain)
> **Hold time:** 2h 14min
>
> **What went right:**
> ✅ Clean breakout setup
> ✅ Entered near support
> ✅ Followed stop loss discipline
> ✅ Took profits at target
>
> **What to improve:**
> - Could have sized up (2 contracts)
> - Missed earlier entry at $3.50
>
> **Grade:** A- Great execution!"

**Log the trade in your journal** (screenshot this for reference).

## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

### 1. Start with Small Size
**First 5-10 trades:** Use 1 contract only
- Learn the process
- Build confidence
- Minimize risk while learning

**After proven success:** Scale to 2-3 contracts

---

### 2. Always Set Stop Loss
**Non-negotiable rule:**
- Set stop IMMEDIATELY after entry
- Never say "I'll watch it"
- Emotions will trick you

**AI gives you the stop level** - use it!

---

### 3. Don't Chase
**If you miss entry:**
- AI said $3.50-$3.70 entry
- Stock gapped to $4.00
- **Don't chase!**
- Wait for pullback or next trade

**Ask AI:** "Is AMD still a good entry at $4.00?"

---

### 4. Take Profits at Target
**Greed is the enemy:**
- AI says target is $5.00
- You hit $5.00
- **Take profits!**
- Don't hope for $6.00

**Rule:** Hit target = close trade (at least 50%)

---

### 5. One Trade at a Time (Beginner)
**Don't overwhelm yourself:**
- Focus on 1 trade
- Learn the process
- Build muscle memory

**After 20+ trades:** Can handle 2-3 positions

---

### 6. Use Quick Prompts
**Time-savers:**
- "Day Trade Options Setup" for specific ticker
- "Pre-Market Movers" for ideas
- "Major Support and Resistance" for levels

**Don't type everything out** - use the prompts!

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes & How to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Not Setting Stop Loss
**Problem:** "I'll just watch it, I don't need a stop"
**Result:** Small loss becomes big loss
**Solution:** Set stop immediately, every single trade

---

### Mistake 2: Ignoring AI's Risk/Reward
**Problem:** AI says 2:1 R/R, you want 10:1
**Result:** Holding too long, giving back profits
**Solution:** Trust the AI's target and stop levels

---

### Mistake 3: Overtrading
**Problem:** AI gives 5 setups, you take all 5
**Result:** Overwhelmed, poor execution
**Solution:** Quality over quantity - 1-2 best setups only

---

### Mistake 4: Skipping Pre-Market Research
**Problem:** Jump right into market open
**Result:** Miss context, take bad trades
**Solution:** 10-minute pre-market AI check (every day)

---

### Mistake 5: Not Adjusting Quantity
**Problem:** AI suggests "5 contracts", you blindly execute
**Result:** Too much risk for your account
**Solution:** Always review and adjust quantity to YOUR risk tolerance

## 🚧 Troubleshooting

### "Execute Trade" Button Not Showing

**Cause:** AI didn't give specific entry price

**Solution:** Ask: "What's the exact entry price for AMD calls?"

**AI will respond with specific price** → Button appears

---

### Order Rejected: Insufficient Buying Power

**Cause:** Not enough cash for the trade

**Solution:**
1. Check Portfolio → Buying Power
2. Reduce quantity (1 contract instead of 2)
3. Or: Choose cheaper strike/expiration

---

### Can't Set Stop Loss

**Cause:** Some brokers don't support stop loss on options via API

**Solution:**
1. Set price alert instead at $2.80
2. When alert hits, manually close position from chat
3. **Say: "Sell my AMD call"** → Execute immediately

---

### Filled at Different Price

**Cause:** Market moved between clicking and filling

**Solution:**
- Use limit orders (not market)
- Set limit at mid-point of AI's range
- Example: AI says $3.50-$3.70, set limit $3.60

---

## 🎓 Level Up: Advanced Variations

### Variation 1: Multiple Contracts
**After mastering 1 contract:**
- Scale to 2-3 contracts
- Sell partial at +25%
- Let remaining run to target

---

### Variation 2: 0DTE Options
**Same-day expiration for experienced traders:**
- Higher risk/reward
- Requires constant monitoring
- Ask AI: "Find me 0DTE options setup"

---

### Variation 3: Stock Day Trading (Not Options)
**Use AI for stock setups:**
> "Find me a day trade setup for stocks with $5K account"

**AI recommends:**
- Stock picks
- Entry/exit levels
- Share quantity
- Execute from chat!

---
