## Regular Market Hours (The Main Session)

### U.S. Stock Market Hours

**New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) & NASDAQ:**
- **Open:** 9:30 AM Eastern Time (ET)
- **Close:** 4:00 PM Eastern Time (ET)
- **Duration:** 6.5 hours per trading day
- **Days:** Monday - Friday (except holidays)

**This is when most trading happens.**
- Highest liquidity (most buyers and sellers)
- Tightest bid-ask spreads
- Best prices
- Safest time for beginners to trade

---

### Converting to Your Time Zone

**If you're not in Eastern Time:**

| Your Time Zone | Market Open | Market Close |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Eastern (ET)** | 9:30 AM | 4:00 PM |
| **Central (CT)** | 8:30 AM | 3:00 PM |
| **Mountain (MT)** | 7:30 AM | 2:00 PM |
| **Pacific (PT)** | 6:30 AM | 1:00 PM |
| **Alaska (AKT)** | 5:30 AM | 12:00 PM |
| **Hawaii (HT)** | 3:30 AM | 10:00 AM |

**Example:**
- You're in California (Pacific Time)
- Market opens at 6:30 AM your time
- Market closes at 1:00 PM your time
- You can trade stocks between 6:30 AM - 1:00 PM PT

---

### Why These Hours?

**Historical reasons:**
- Aligned with business hours on East Coast (financial center)
- Allows time for news digestion before open
- Gives institutions time to process orders after close

**Modern reality:**
- Most investors don't trade during all 6.5 hours
- Many people trade in first 30 minutes (9:30-10:00 AM ET) = highest volume
- Last 30 minutes (3:30-4:00 PM ET) = second highest volume ("power hour")
- Middle of day (11 AM - 3 PM ET) = slower, less volatile

---

## Pre-Market Trading

### What Is Pre-Market?

**Pre-Market Hours:**
- **Start:** 4:00 AM Eastern Time (ET)
- **End:** 9:30 AM Eastern Time (ET)
- **Duration:** 5.5 hours before regular market opens

**What happens:**
- Some traders and institutions trade before market officially opens
- Limited number of participants
- Lower volume than regular hours
- News and earnings often released during pre-market

---

### Who Trades Pre-Market?

**Typically:**
- Professional traders
- Hedge funds and institutions
- Day traders reacting to overnight news
- Earnings traders (companies announce before market opens)

**Not typically:**
- Long-term investors
- Complete beginners
- Casual investors

---

### Pre-Market Characteristics

**Lower liquidity:**
- Fewer buyers and sellers
- Harder to find someone to trade with
- Larger price swings on small volume

**Wider spreads:**
- Bid-ask spread can be 5-10x wider than regular hours
- Example: Regular hours $0.02 spread → Pre-market $0.20 spread
- You pay significantly more buying, get significantly less selling

**More volatility:**
- Prices can swing wildly on low volume
- 100-share order might move stock 1%
- Not representative of where stock will trade during regular hours

**Reacts to overnight news:**
- Earnings announcements (many companies report before market open)
- International market movements (Europe, Asia)
- Breaking news overnight
- Federal Reserve announcements

---

### Pre-Market Risks for Beginners

**Risk #1: Fake Prices**

**What happens:**
- Pre-market: Stock shows $105
- You place market order thinking that's the price
- Regular market opens at 9:30 AM at $100
- Your order fills at $100
- You were misled by pre-market price

---

**Risk #2: Wide Spreads Cost You Money**

**Example:**

**Regular hours:**
- Bid: $99.98 / Ask: $100.00
- Spread: $0.02 (0.02%)

**Pre-market:**
- Bid: $99.50 / Ask: $100.50
- Spread: $1.00 (1%)

**If you buy in pre-market:**
- Pay $100.50 (the ask)
- Immediately worth $99.50 (the bid)
- Instant 1% loss just from spread!

---

**Risk #3: Low Volume = Price Manipulation**

**What happens:**
- Only 500 shares traded in pre-market
- Stock shows as "up 10%"
- Looks like strong momentum
- Regular market opens, floods with volume
- Price returns to normal
- **Pre-market move was meaningless**

---

### When to Trade Pre-Market (Advanced Only)

**Only trade pre-market if:**
- ✅ You're an experienced trader
- ✅ You understand extended hours risks
- ✅ There's legitimate catalyst (earnings, FDA approval, etc.)
- ✅ You use limit orders (never market orders)
- ✅ You accept wider spreads and volatility

**Beginners: Skip pre-market trading entirely.**

---

---

## After-Hours Trading

### What Is After-Hours?

**After-Hours Trading:**
- **Start:** 4:00 PM Eastern Time (ET) (right when regular market closes)
- **End:** 8:00 PM Eastern Time (ET)
- **Duration:** 4 hours after regular market close

**What happens:**
- Continued trading after regular hours close
- Many companies release earnings after market closes (4:00-4:30 PM)
- Allows reaction to late-breaking news
- Similar characteristics to pre-market (low volume, wide spreads)

---

### After-Hours Characteristics

**Similar to pre-market:**
- Lower liquidity
- Wider bid-ask spreads
- More volatility
- Not representative of next day's opening price

**Common catalysts:**
- Earnings announcements (many companies report after 4 PM)
- Breaking news after business hours
- Federal Reserve announcements (sometimes 2 PM, affects after-hours)
- International developments

---

### After-Hours Risks

**Same risks as pre-market:**
- Wide spreads cost you money
- Low volume = big price swings
- Prices not representative
- Easy to overpay or get bad execution

**Additional risk: Earnings volatility**

**Example:**

Apple announces earnings at 4:05 PM (after market close)
- Regular market closed at $175.50
- Earnings miss expectations
- After-hours: Stock drops to $165 on low volume (down 6%)
- Panic selling in after-hours
- Next morning (9:30 AM): Stock opens at $170 (recovered 50% of drop)
- **After-hours overreacted**

**If you sold in after-hours at $165, you got worst price.**
**Better to wait for regular hours at $170.**

---

### When to Use After-Hours (Advanced)

**Only trade after-hours if:**
- ✅ You're experienced
- ✅ Reacting to earnings on position you own
- ✅ Using limit orders only
- ✅ Accept wide spreads
- ✅ Understand prices may be temporary

**Beginners: Wait for regular market hours the next day.**

---

**Full Trading Day Timeline (Eastern Time):**

                     [Highest volume, most volatile]

10:00 AM - 3:30 PM = Mid-Day (5.5 hours)
                     [Normal trading, moderate volume]

## Best Times to Trade (For Beginners)

### The Safest Window: 10:00 AM - 3:30 PM ET

**Why this is best for beginners:**
- ✅ Tight spreads (lowest cost)
- ✅ Good liquidity (easy to buy/sell)
- ✅ Less volatility (calmer price movements)
- ✅ Opening chaos has settled
- ✅ Closing rush hasn't started

**Recommended for:**
- Long-term investors
- First-time buyers
- Anyone buying index ETFs
- Investors who want fair prices

---

### Avoid: First 30 Minutes (9:30-10:00 AM ET)

**Why beginners should avoid:**
- Extreme volatility (prices swing wildly)
- Professionals dominate this time
- Algorithms and high-frequency traders active
- Hard to get good price
- Easy to get caught in fake moves

**What happens at open:**
- Overnight news gets digested
- Orders built up overnight all execute at once
- Huge volume spike
- Prices can swing 2-5% in minutes
- Then often revert back

**Example:**

Stock closed yesterday at $100
- Overnight news: slightly positive
- 9:30 AM open: Stock gaps up to $103 (3% jump)
- Beginners see "momentum" and buy at $103
- By 10:00 AM: Stock settles back to $101
- **Beginners overpaid by $2/share (2%)**

**Better strategy:**
- Wait 30 minutes for dust to settle
- See where price stabilizes
- Make more informed decision

---

### Avoid: Last 30 Minutes (3:30-4:00 PM ET)

**Why beginners should avoid:**
- "Power Hour" = high volume and volatility
- Institutional rebalancing
- Day traders closing positions
- Prices can swing significantly

**What happens at close:**
- Fund managers adjust portfolios
- Day traders must close positions (can't hold overnight)
- Algorithms maximize volume
- Price swings can be dramatic

**For beginners:**
- Avoid trading 3:30-4:00 PM
- If you must, use limit orders
- Don't chase price movements

---

### Best Strategy for Beginners

**Simple rule:**
**Trade between 10:30 AM - 3:00 PM Eastern Time**

**In your time zone:**
| Time Zone | Best Trading Window |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Eastern | 10:30 AM - 3:00 PM |
| Central | 9:30 AM - 2:00 PM |
| Mountain | 8:30 AM - 1:00 PM |
| Pacific | 7:30 AM - 12:00 PM |

**During this window:**
- Place your limit orders
- Buy index ETFs
- Make long-term investments
- Get fair prices

## Weekend Trading (Crypto vs Stocks)

### Stocks: Weekends = Closed

**U.S. stock market:**
- ❌ Closed Saturdays and Sundays
- ❌ No trading Friday 8 PM - Monday 4 AM
- ❌ Cannot buy or sell stocks on weekends

**What you can do on weekends:**
- ✅ Research stocks
- ✅ Plan your trades for Monday
- ✅ Paper trade on Ape AI
- ✅ Read earnings reports
- ✅ Set limit orders for Monday open (won't execute until market opens)

**Weekend news:**
- News can break on weekends
- Affects Monday's opening price
- Creates "gap" (stock opens higher/lower than Friday close)

---

### Crypto: 24/7/365

**Cryptocurrency markets (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.):**
- ✅ Open 24 hours a day
- ✅ Open 7 days a week
- ✅ Open 365 days a year (including holidays)
- Never closes

**Key difference:**
- Stocks = business days only
- Crypto = every day, all day

**Some brokers (like Robinhood) allow crypto trading 24/7 but stocks only during market hours.**

---

## International Markets

### When Other Major Markets Are Open

**If you trade international stocks through ADRs or international brokers:**

**London Stock Exchange (LSE):**
- 3:00 AM - 11:30 AM Eastern Time
- Overlaps with early U.S. pre-market and morning

**Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX):**
- 9:30 PM - 4:00 AM Eastern Time (next day)
- Trades while U.S. sleeps

**Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE):**
- 8:00 PM - 2:30 AM Eastern Time (next day)
- Trades while U.S. sleeps

**Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FRA):**
- 3:00 AM - 11:30 AM Eastern Time
- Overlaps with U.S. pre-market

**Why this matters:**
- International news affects U.S. stocks
- If European markets drop 3%, U.S. market often opens lower
- Gives preview of sentiment before U.S. open

---

## Common Questions

### "Can I place an order when the market is closed?"

**Yes, but it won't execute until market opens.**

**What happens:**
1. You place limit order Saturday at noon
2. Order sits in queue
3. Monday 9:30 AM: Market opens, your order becomes active
4. Executes if price reaches your limit

**Risk:**
- Stock might gap (open much higher/lower than Friday close)
- Your limit order might fill at worse price than expected
- Or might not fill at all if gap went past your limit

---

### "What if I try to place a market order after hours?"

**Depends on broker:**

**If extended hours NOT enabled:**
- Order queues for next market open
- Executes at 9:30 AM (or next trading day if weekend)

**If extended hours enabled:**
- Order executes in after-hours market
- You'll pay wider spread
- Get after-hours price

**Most brokers default to NOT allowing extended hours unless you specifically enable it.**

---

### "Why don't they keep the market open 24/7 like crypto?"

**Historical reasons:**
- Stock market existed before computers
- Needed time to process paper trades
- Participants needed rest

**Modern reasons:**
- Circuit breakers and system maintenance happen overnight
- Regulators can review day's activity
- Prevents non-stop volatility and exhaustion
- Allows fair playing field (everyone gets rest)

**Proposal for 24/7 stocks:**
- Some have proposed it
- SEC has not approved
- Likely won't happen soon

---

### "Can I cancel an order placed when market is closed?"

**Yes!**

- You can cancel any limit order anytime before it fills
- Weekend order can be cancelled Sunday night before Monday open
- Go to "Open Orders" and click "Cancel"
