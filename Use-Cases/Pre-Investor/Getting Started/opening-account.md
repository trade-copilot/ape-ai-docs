## Before You Start: What You'll Need

### Required Information (Everyone Needs This)

**Personal Information:**
- Full legal name (as it appears on your ID)
- Date of birth
- Social Security Number (SSN) or Tax ID
- Physical residential address (no P.O. boxes)
- Email address
- Phone number

**Employment Information:**
- Employment status (employed, unemployed, student, retired)
- Employer name (if employed)
- Occupation type (e.g., "Software Engineer", "Teacher")

**Financial Information:**

**Banking Information (for funding later):**
- Bank name
- Bank account number
- Bank routing number

**Identification:**
- Driver's license OR passport OR state ID

### Why They Ask for This

**"Why do they need my SSN?"**
- IRS requires it (you'll get tax forms like 1099 for investment gains)
- Prevents fraud and identity theft
- Required by law for financial accounts

**"Why do they need my income and net worth?"**
- Regulatory requirement (FINRA rules)
- Helps them understand your risk tolerance
- Determines what account features you can access (like options trading)
- **Note:** They don't verify this - reasonable estimates are fine

**"Is my information secure?"**
- Yes. Brokerages use bank-level encryption
- SIPC insurance protects up to $500,000 of securities
- Regulated by SEC and FINRA
- Major brokerages have been doing this for decades

## Choosing Your Account Type

### The Three Main Account Types

**1. Individual Brokerage Account (Most Common for Beginners)**

**What it is:**
- Standard account in your name only
- You own everything in the account
- No restrictions on contributions or withdrawals

**Best for:**
- First-time investors
- People who want flexibility
- Anyone who might need the money before retirement

**Tax treatment:**
- Pay taxes on dividends and capital gains each year
- No contribution limits
- Can withdraw anytime without penalties

**Pros:**
- ✅ Complete flexibility
- ✅ No withdrawal penalties
- ✅ No contribution limits
- ✅ Can access money anytime

**Cons:**
- ❌ Pay taxes on gains every year
- ❌ No tax advantages like retirement accounts

**Example:**
Sarah (age 28) wants to start investing $500/month. She's not sure if she'll need the money for a house down payment in 5 years, so she opens an individual account for maximum flexibility.

---

**2. Traditional IRA (Individual Retirement Account)**

**What it is:**
- Retirement account with tax advantages
- Contributions may be tax-deductible
- Money grows tax-free until retirement

**Best for:**
- Long-term retirement savings
- People who want to reduce current taxes
- Anyone who won't need the money until age 59½

**Tax treatment:**
- Contributions may be tax-deductible (reduces current taxes)
- Investments grow tax-free

**Contribution limits (2024):**
- $7,000/year if under age 50

- ✅ Tax-free growth for decades
- ✅ Forces disciplined retirement saving

**Cons:**
- ❌ Can't withdraw before 59½ without 10% penalty
- ❌ Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) at age 73
- ❌ Annual contribution limits

**Example:**
Mike (age 35) wants to save for retirement. He opens a Traditional IRA and contributes $7,000/year. This reduces his taxable income by $7,000, saving him $1,680 in taxes (24% bracket).

---

**3. Roth IRA (Tax-Free Retirement Account)**

**What it is:**
- Retirement account funded with after-tax money
- Grows completely tax-free
- Withdrawals in retirement are tax-free

**Best for:**
- Young people who expect higher income later
- Anyone who wants tax-free retirement income
- People in lower tax brackets now

**Tax treatment:**

**Contribution limits (2024):**
- $7,000/year if under age 50
- $8,000/year if age 50+

**Pros:**
- ✅ Tax-free growth forever
- ✅ Tax-free withdrawals in retirement
- ✅ No Required Minimum Distributions
- ✅ Can withdraw contributions anytime (not gains)

**Cons:**
- ❌ No tax deduction on contributions
- ❌ Income limits for eligibility
- ❌ Can't withdraw gains before 59½ without penalty

**Example:**
Jessica (age 25, income $65,000) opens a Roth IRA. She expects to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement. By contributing $7,000/year for 40 years at 10% return, she'll have $3.5 million tax-free in retirement.

## Common Roadblocks and Solutions

### Problem: "My ID Photo Keeps Getting Rejected"

**Why this happens:**
- Photo is blurry or out of focus
- Corners of ID are cut off
- Glare from lighting
- ID is expired
- Photo taken at angle instead of straight-on

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Use good lighting (natural light works best)
- ✅ Place ID on dark, solid surface
- ✅ Ensure all four corners are visible in photo
- ✅ Take photo straight-on, not at angle
- ✅ Check that ID is not expired
- ✅ Use phone camera, not webcam (better quality)
- ✅ Don't use flash (causes glare)

**If still not working:**
- Try different device (phone vs tablet vs computer)
- Call broker's customer service - they can verify manually
- Try desktop version if mobile app isn't working

---

### Problem: "Identity Verification Failed"

**Why this happens:**
- Address on application doesn't match credit bureau records
- Recent move (address not updated everywhere)
- Credit freeze on your file
- Name spelling discrepancy

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Use EXACT address that matches your driver's license
- ✅ Check if you have credit freeze - temporarily lift it
- ✅ Ensure name spelling matches SSN records exactly
- ✅ Check for Jr., Sr., II, III suffixes - must match exactly
- ✅ Recent address change? Use old address that's still in credit bureaus

**Alternative verification:**
- Most brokers will call you to verify identity manually
- May ask security questions about your credit history
- May accept utility bill or bank statement as proof of address

---

### Problem: "Application is Stuck in 'Under Review' for Days"

**Why this happens:**
- Additional verification required
- High volume of applications
- Incomplete information
- Suspected fraud flags (not your fault - algorithms are sensitive)

**What to do:**
- ✅ Check email and spam folder for requests from broker
- ✅ Call customer service directly
- ✅ Log in to check application status
- ✅ Have ID ready in case they need to verify over phone

**Don't worry:**
- This is normal for 5-10% of applications
- Doesn't mean you're rejected
- Usually resolved within 24-48 hours

---

### Problem: "I Don't Have a Driver's License"

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Use passport (all brokers accept this)
- ✅ Use state-issued ID card
- ✅ Some brokers accept military ID
- ✅ Some brokers accept permanent resident card (green card)

**If you have none of these:**
- Apply for state-issued ID card at your local DMV
- Takes 1-2 weeks but inexpensive ($10-30)

---

### Problem: "I'm Self-Employed and Don't Have Employer Name"

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Select "Self-Employed" for employment status
- ✅ Enter your business name as employer
- ✅ If no business name, enter "Self-Employed" or "Independent Contractor"
- ✅ For occupation, describe what you do (e.g., "Freelance Designer")

---

### Problem: "I Don't Know My Net Worth"

**Solution - Quick Net Worth Calculation:**

**Assets (what you own):**
- Bank accounts: $___
- Investment accounts: $___
- Retirement accounts: $___
- Car value: $___
- Home value (if you own): $___
- Other valuables: $___
**Total Assets: $___**

**Liabilities (what you owe):**
- Credit card debt: $___
- Student loans: $___
- Car loan: $___
- Mortgage: $___
- Other debts: $___
**Total Liabilities: $___**

**Net Worth = Assets - Liabilities**

**Liquid Net Worth = Cash + Investments only (not car or house)**

**Tip:** Rough estimates are fine - brokers don't verify this.

---

### Problem: "I'm Under 18"

**Reality:**
- You cannot open a brokerage account if you're under 18
- Federal law requires you to be 18+ (age of majority)

**Solution: Custodial Accounts**
- Parent or guardian can open custodial account (UGMA/UTMA)
- Money legally belongs to you, but parent manages until you're 18

**If you're in the U.S. on visa:**
- ✅ Most major brokers allow non-citizens with SSN or ITIN

**If you're outside the U.S.:**
- ✅ Interactive Brokers accepts international clients
- ✅ TD Ameritrade International
- ✅ Webull (limited countries)
- ❌ Robinhood, Fidelity, Schwab are U.S. only

**Tax implications:**

## Security Best Practices

### Protecting Your Account

**2. Enable 2-Factor Authentication (2FA)**

- Check that URL starts with https://
- Look for official domain (fidelity.com, schwab.com)
- Beware of typosquatting (fidelty.com, schwabb.com)

**5. Use Biometric Login**
- Face ID or fingerprint
- Faster and more secure than typing password
- Available on all major broker apps

**6. Set Up Account Alerts**
- Email/text for:
  - Login from new device
  - Password changes
  - Bank account changes
  - Large withdrawals
  - Trade confirmations

**7. Keep Email Account Secure**
