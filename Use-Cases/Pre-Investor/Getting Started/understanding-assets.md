## The Four Basic Asset Types

### Quick Overview Table

| Asset | What It Is | Return | Risk | Best For |
|-------|-----------|--------|------|----------|
| **Cash** | Money in bank | 0.1-5% | Very Low | Emergency fund, short-term |
| **Bonds** | Loans to companies/govt | 3-6% | Low | Stability, income, older investors |
| **Stocks** | Ownership in companies | 8-12% | Medium-High | Growth, long-term wealth |
| **ETFs** | Baskets of stocks/bonds | Varies | Varies | Diversification, beginners |

Now let's dive deep into each one.

## CASH (Savings Accounts, Money Market, CDs)

### What It Is

**Simple definition:** Money sitting in a bank account earning minimal interest.

**Types of cash:**
- **Checking Account**: 0% interest, daily access
- **Savings Account**: 0.1-0.5% interest, easy access
- **High-Yield Savings**: 4-5% interest, online banks
- **Money Market**: 3-5% interest, limited transactions
- **CD (Certificate of Deposit)**: 4-5% interest, locked for set time

### How It Makes Money

**Interest:**
- Bank pays you a small percentage annually
- Example: $10,000 at 4% = $400/year
- Compounded monthly or daily

**Why so low:**
- Banks use your money to lend to others
- They pay you tiny interest
- They charge borrowers much higher rates
- They keep the difference as profit

### Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
- ✅ Zero risk (FDIC insured up to $250k)
- ✅ Instant access to money
- ✅ No market volatility
- ✅ Guaranteed return
- ✅ Easy to understand

**Cons:**
- ❌ Very low returns (0.1-5%)
- ❌ Usually loses to inflation (3-4%)
- ❌ Opportunity cost (missing stock gains)
- ❌ Won't build significant wealth

### When to Use Cash

**Perfect for:**
- Emergency fund (3-6 months expenses)
- Money needed within 1 year
- Down payment being saved
- Security and peace of mind

**Not good for:**
- Long-term wealth building
- Retirement savings
- Growing significant money
- Beating inflation

### Example

**Sarah's Emergency Fund:**
```
Amount: $10,000
Account: High-yield savings at 4.5%
Annual return: $450
Purpose: Cover unexpected expenses
Time horizon: Keep indefinitely

This is CORRECT use of cash.
She's not trying to grow wealth here,
just preserve capital safely.
```

## BONDS (Fixed Income Securities)

### What They Are

**Simple definition:** You loan money to a company or government. They pay you interest and return your money later.

**Think of it like:**
- You're the bank
- Company/government is the borrower
- They pay you interest for the loan
- They promise to pay you back

**Types of bonds:**
- **Government Bonds** (Treasury): Safest, lowest return (3-5%)
- **Corporate Bonds**: Medium risk, medium return (4-7%)
- **Municipal Bonds**: Tax-free, state/local govt (3-5%)
- **Junk Bonds**: High risk, high return (7-12%)

### How They Make Money

**Two ways:**

**1. Interest Payments (Coupons)**
- Paid every 6 months typically
- Example: $10,000 bond at 5% = $500/year

**2. Price Appreciation**
- Bonds can trade above/below face value
- If rates fall, bond prices rise (and vice versa)
- Can sell before maturity for profit/loss

### Example Bond

**10-Year US Treasury Bond:**
```
Face Value: $10,000
Coupon Rate: 4.5%
Maturity: 10 years

Year 1-10: Receive $450/year (semi-annual payments)
Year 10: Receive $10,000 back (principal)

Total return over 10 years: $4,500 interest + $10,000 principal
```

### Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
- ✅ Predictable income (fixed interest)
- ✅ Lower risk than stocks
- ✅ Priority in bankruptcy (paid before stockholders)
- ✅ Diversification (negative correlation to stocks sometimes)
- ✅ Capital preservation

**Cons:**
- ❌ Lower returns than stocks (3-6% vs 10%)
- ❌ Interest rate risk (rates up = bond prices down)
- ❌ Inflation risk (fixed payments lose value)
- ❌ Opportunity cost (missing stock gains)
- ❌ More complex than stocks

### When to Use Bonds

**Perfect for:**
- Older investors (50s-60s+)
- Conservative portfolios
- Reducing portfolio volatility
- Steady income needs
- Balancing stock risk

**Not good for:**
- Young investors (20s-30s)
- Aggressive growth goals
- High inflation environments
- Maximum wealth building

### Portfolio Example

**Age-Based Bond Allocation:**
```
Age 20-30: 10-20% bonds
Age 30-40: 20-30% bonds
Age 40-50: 30-40% bonds
Age 50-60: 40-50% bonds
Age 60+: 50-60% bonds

Rule of Thumb: Bond % = Your Age
(30 years old = 30% bonds, 70% stocks)
```

---

## STOCKS (Equities)

### What They Are

**Simple definition:** You own a tiny piece of a company. If the company grows, your piece becomes more valuable.

**Think of it like:**
- Owning a slice of a pizza
- If the pizza business grows, your slice is worth more
- If the business shrinks, your slice is worth less
- You can sell your slice anytime

**Key concept: Ownership**
- Stocks = equity = ownership
- You're a part-owner (shareholder)
- You share in profits and losses
- You have voting rights (usually)

### How They Make Money

**Two ways:**

**1. Capital Appreciation (Stock Price Goes Up)**
```
Buy AAPL at $150/share
Sell AAPL at $180/share
Profit: $30/share (20% gain)

This is the main way most people make money.
```

**2. Dividends (Company Shares Profits)**
```
Own 100 shares of KO (Coca-Cola)
KO pays $1.76/share dividend annually
You receive: $176/year in cash

Some companies pay dividends, others don't.
Growth companies (TSLA, NVDA) usually don't pay dividends.
Value companies (KO, JNJ) usually do.
```

### Types of Stocks

**By Size (Market Cap):**
- **Mega-Cap**: $200B+ (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL)
  - Safest stocks, slower growth
- **Large-Cap**: $10-200B (UBER, COIN, SHOP)
  - Stable, moderate growth
- **Mid-Cap**: $2-10B (Many established companies)
  - Balance of growth and stability
- **Small-Cap**: $300M-2B (Emerging companies)
  - Higher risk, higher growth potential
- **Micro-Cap**: Under $300M (Very risky)
  - Extremely volatile, penny stocks

**By Style:**
- **Growth Stocks**: Fast-growing, no dividends (TSLA, NVDA)
- **Value Stocks**: Undervalued, dividends (F, BAC)
- **Dividend Stocks**: High dividend yield (T, VZ)
- **Blue-Chip Stocks**: Large, stable, established (JNJ, PG)

### Example Stock Investment

**Buying Apple Stock:**
```
Company: Apple Inc. (AAPL)
Price: $175/share
You buy: 10 shares
Cost: $1,750

What you own:
- 10/15,000,000,000 of Apple (tiny fraction)
- Rights to future profits (dividends)
- Rights to future growth (stock appreciation)

If AAPL goes to $200:
- Your 10 shares worth: $2,000
- Profit: $250 (14.3% gain)

If AAPL drops to $150:
- Your 10 shares worth: $1,500
- Loss: -$250 (-14.3% loss)
```

### Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
- ✅ Highest long-term returns (10% annually)
- ✅ Ownership in real companies
- ✅ Infinite upside potential
- ✅ Liquidity (sell anytime)
- ✅ Dividends provide income
- ✅ Historically beat inflation

**Cons:**
- ❌ Volatile (can drop 50%+ in crashes)
- ❌ Requires research and knowledge
- ❌ Can lose 100% if company fails
- ❌ Emotional rollercoaster
- ❌ No guaranteed returns
- ❌ Tax implications on gains

### Historical Returns

**S&P 500 (500 largest US companies):**
```
100-year average: 10% annually
Last 50 years: 10.5% annually
Last 30 years: 10.7% annually
Last 10 years: 13.2% annually

$10,000 invested in 1994:
Today (2024): $136,500
That's 13.7x your money!
```

**But it's not smooth:**
- 2000-2002: -40% (dot-com crash)
- 2008: -37% (financial crisis)
- 2020: -34% (COVID crash)
- 2022: -18% (inflation/rates)

**The key:** Hold through the crashes. They always recover.

### When to Use Stocks

**Perfect for:**
- Young investors (20s-40s)
- Long-term goals (10+ years)
- Wealth building
- Retirement savings
- Aggressive growth

**Not good for:**
- Short-term money (< 3 years)
- Emergency funds
- Risk-averse investors
- Money you can't afford to lose

## ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds)

### What They Are

**Think of it like:**

- One purchase = own hundreds of companies
- Instant diversification

Top holdings in VOO:
1. Apple - 7%
2. Microsoft - 6.5%
3. Amazon - 3.5%
4. NVIDIA - 3%

If you bought each individually:

## Common Questions

### "Which asset is best?"

**There is no "best" - it depends on:**
- Your age
- Your goals
- Your time horizon
- Your risk tolerance

**Yes, in the short term.**

**But historically:**

### "Should I pick stocks or buy ETFs?"

**For beginners: ETFs 100%**

**Why:**
- Lower risk
- Easier
- Requires less time/knowledge
