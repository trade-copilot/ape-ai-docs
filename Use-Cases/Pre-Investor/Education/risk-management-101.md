## The Fundamental Truth About Risk

### Risk and Return Are Related

**The risk-return tradeoff:**
- Higher potential returns = higher risk
- Lower risk = lower potential returns
- Can't eliminate risk entirely (or returns disappear)
- Goal is to manage risk, not avoid it

**The spectrum:**

```
Low Risk,          Medium Risk,         High Risk,
Low Return         Medium Return        High Return

Savings            Index Funds          Individual Stocks
Account            (VOO, VTI)          (Apple, Tesla)
0.5% return       10% return          -50% to +100% return
```

---

### The Two Types of Risk

**Systematic Risk (Market Risk):**
- Can't be eliminated
- Affects entire market
- Examples: Recession, pandemic, war, interest rates
- Managed by: Asset allocation (stocks vs bonds vs cash)

**Unsystematic Risk (Company-Specific Risk):**
- CAN be eliminated
- Affects individual companies
- Examples: CEO quits, product fails, scandal
- Managed by: Diversification (own many companies, not one)

**Goal:** Eliminate unsystematic risk through diversification. Accept systematic risk for returns.

---

## Rule #1: Emergency Fund Before Investing

### Why This is Non-Negotiable

**The scenario without emergency fund:**

You invest all your savings ($10,000) in stocks.
- Month 2: Car needs $2,000 repair
- You have no emergency fund
- You're forced to sell stocks to pay for repair
- Stock market happened to be down 10% that month
- You sell at $9,000 → Lost $1,000 plus repair costs
- **Forced selling at wrong time destroyed your wealth**

---

### The Emergency Fund Rule

**Before investing a single dollar:**

**3-6 months of expenses in high-yield savings account**

**Calculate your emergency fund:**

```
Monthly essential expenses: $_______
× 6 months = $_______
Current savings: $_______
Emergency fund gap: $_______
```

**Example:**

Monthly expenses: $3,000
× 6 months = $18,000 needed
Current savings: $5,000
Gap: $13,000 → **Build this FIRST before investing**

---

### Where to Keep Emergency Fund

**High-yield savings account:**
- Current rates: 4-5% APY
- FDIC insured (safe)
- Instantly accessible
- No risk of loss

**Popular options:**
- Marcus by Goldman Sachs
- Ally Bank
- American Express Personal Savings
- Capital One 360

**NOT in:**
- ❌ Stocks (too volatile)
- ❌ Bonds (not liquid enough)
- ❌ Crypto (too risky)
- ❌ Under your mattress (earns nothing)

---

## Rule #2: Never Invest Money You Can't Afford to Lose

### The Time Horizon Rule

**Only invest money you won't need for 5+ years**

**Why 5 years minimum?**
- Stock market can be down for 1-3 years
- Need time to recover from downturns
- Short-term volatility is normal
- Long-term, market always trends up

**Timeline-based allocation:**

**Need money in 0-1 years:**
- 100% high-yield savings
- Example: Rent, car repair, wedding in 6 months

**Need money in 1-3 years:**
- 80% savings, 20% bonds
- Example: House down payment in 2 years

**Need money in 3-5 years:**
- 50% savings, 30% bonds, 20% stocks
- Example: Car purchase in 4 years

**Need money in 5+ years:**
- 80-100% stocks
- Example: Retirement in 30 years

---

### The Catastrophe Test

**Ask yourself before investing:**

"If I lost 50% of this money tomorrow, would it destroy my life?"

**If YES:**
- ❌ Don't invest it
- ✅ Keep it in high-yield savings

**If NO:**
- ✅ Okay to invest
- ✅ You can handle the volatility

**Example:**

You have $20,000:
- $18,000 emergency fund → KEEP IN SAVINGS
- $2,000 extra → Okay to invest (losing it won't destroy you)

---

## Rule #3: Position Sizing (Don't Bet the Farm)

### The Rule of Maximum Position Size

**Never put more than 5-10% of portfolio in single stock**

**Why?**
- Any company can fail (even Apple, Amazon, Google)
- Bankruptcy = 100% loss
- Bad earnings = 30-50% drop overnight
- One position can't destroy you if properly sized

---

### Position Sizing Examples

**Portfolio: $10,000**

**Bad position sizing:**
- $9,000 in Tesla (90% of portfolio)
- $1,000 in cash
- Tesla drops 50% → Portfolio drops to $5,500 (-45% total)
- **Catastrophic loss from one position**

**Good position sizing:**
- $1,000 in Apple (10%)
- $1,000 in Microsoft (10%)
- $1,000 in Amazon (10%)
- $7,000 in VOO index fund (70%)
- Even if Apple goes to $0 → Portfolio only down 10%
- **Manageable risk**

---

### The Beginner's Position Sizing Strategy

**For your first year of investing:**

**70-80% in index funds:**
- VOO (S&P 500) or VTI (Total Market)
- Instant diversification across 500-4,000 companies
- Impossible to lose everything (would require all U.S. companies to fail)

**20-30% in individual stocks (optional):**
- No more than 5% per stock
- So 4-6 different stocks max
- Only stocks you research and understand

**Example: $10,000 portfolio**
- $7,000 in VOO (70%)
- $500 in Apple (5%)
- $500 in Microsoft (5%)
- $500 in Disney (5%)
- $500 in Nike (5%)
- $1,000 cash (10%)

**If any one stock goes to zero:** You lose only 5%, not 100%.

---

## Rule #4: Diversification (The Only Free Lunch)

### Why Diversify?

**"Don't put all eggs in one basket"**

**The math:**

**Portfolio A: 100% Tesla**
- Tesla drops 50% → Portfolio drops 50%
- Catastrophic

**Portfolio B: 10 different stocks (10% each)**
- Tesla drops 50% → Portfolio drops 5%
- Manageable

**Portfolio C: VOO (500 stocks)**
- One stock drops 50% → Portfolio drops 0.1%
- Barely noticeable

---

### Types of Diversification

**1. Across Companies**
- Own 10-20+ different stocks
- Or use index funds (instant diversification across hundreds)

**2. Across Sectors**
- Technology (Apple, Microsoft)
- Healthcare (Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer)
- Finance (JPMorgan, Visa)
- Consumer (Coca-Cola, Nike)
- Energy (Exxon, Chevron)

**Why:** If tech sector crashes, healthcare might be fine.

**3. Across Asset Classes**
- Stocks (growth)
- Bonds (stability)
- Cash (safety)
- Real estate (optional)

**Why:** When stocks drop, bonds often rise (negative correlation).

**4. Across Geographies**
- U.S. stocks (60-70%)
- International developed (20-30%) - Europe, Japan, Canada
- Emerging markets (10-20%) - China, India, Brazil

**Why:** If U.S. economy slows, international might still grow.

---

### The Lazy Portfolio (Perfect Diversification)

**Option 1: Single Fund**
- 100% in VT (Vanguard Total World Stock ETF)
- Owns 9,000+ stocks worldwide
- Instant global diversification
- Set it and forget it

**Option 2: Three-Fund Portfolio**
- 60% VTI (Total U.S. Stock Market)
- 30% VXUS (Total International Stock Market)
- 10% BND (Total U.S. Bond Market)
- Globally diversified across stocks and bonds

**Option 3: Target Date Fund**
- Example: Vanguard Target Retirement 2060
- Automatically diversified and rebalanced
- Becomes more conservative as you age
- True set-it-and-forget-it

---

## Rule #5: Asset Allocation (Stocks vs Bonds vs Cash)

### What Is Asset Allocation?

**How you divide your money across different asset types:**
- Stocks (high risk, high return)
- Bonds (low risk, low return)
- Cash (no risk, minimal return)

**The most important investment decision you'll make**
- More important than which stocks to pick
- Determines 90% of your returns and risk
- Changes based on age and goals

---

### Asset Allocation by Age

**The rule of thumb: "110 minus your age = % in stocks"**

**Age 25:**
- 110 - 25 = 85% stocks
- 15% bonds/cash
- **Aggressive growth (long time horizon)**

**Age 40:**
- 110 - 40 = 70% stocks
- 30% bonds/cash
- **Moderate growth**

**Age 60:**
- 110 - 60 = 50% stocks
- 50% bonds/cash
- **Conservative (nearing retirement)**

**Age 75 (retired):**
- 110 - 75 = 35% stocks
- 65% bonds/cash
- **Capital preservation**

---

### Asset Allocation by Time Horizon

**Goal in 5-10 years (house down payment):**
- 40% stocks
- 40% bonds
- 20% cash

**Goal in 10-20 years (kid's college):**
- 70% stocks
- 25% bonds
- 5% cash

**Goal in 30+ years (retirement):**
- 90-100% stocks
- 0-10% bonds
- 0% cash

---

### Sample Portfolios

**Aggressive (Age 20-35):**
```
90% stocks:
  - 63% VOO (S&P 500)
  - 27% VXUS (International)
10% BND (Bonds)
```

**Moderate (Age 35-55):**
```
70% stocks:
  - 49% VOO
  - 21% VXUS
30% bonds:
  - 25% BND
  - 5% cash
```

**Conservative (Age 55-70):**
```
50% stocks:
  - 35% VOO
  - 15% VXUS
50% bonds:
  - 40% BND
  - 10% cash
```

**Retired (Age 70+):**
```
30% stocks:
  - 21% VOO
  - 9% VXUS
70% bonds/cash:
  - 50% BND
  - 20% cash
```

---

## Rule #6: Rebalancing (Maintain Your Allocation)

### Why Rebalance?

**The scenario:**

**Start of year:** $10,000 portfolio
- 80% stocks ($8,000)
- 20% bonds ($2,000)

**End of year:** Stocks up 20%, Bonds up 5%
- Stocks: $9,600 (85% of portfolio)
- Bonds: $2,100 (15% of portfolio)
- **Total: $11,700**

**Problem:** You're now 85/15 instead of target 80/20
- More risk than intended
- Drifted from plan

---

### How to Rebalance

**Annual rebalancing:**

**Step 1:** Check allocation
- Stocks: 85% (target: 80%)
- Bonds: 15% (target: 20%)

**Step 2:** Sell winners, buy losers
- Sell $585 of stocks
- Buy $585 of bonds
- **Back to 80/20**

**Or use new contributions:**
- Instead of selling, direct new money to underweight assets
- Adding $1,000 new money? Put it all in bonds until back to 80/20

---

### Rebalancing Frequency

**Once per year:** Most common and efficient
- Less trading = lower taxes and fees
- Annual is enough to stay on track

**Quarterly:** If you prefer more control
- More work
- Potentially more taxes

**Never:** Not recommended
- Drift too far from plan
- Take on unintended risk

---

## Rule #7: Stop-Losses (When and When NOT to Use)

### What Are Stop-Losses?

**Stop-loss = Automatic sell order if price drops to certain level**

Example:
- Buy Tesla at $250
- Set stop-loss at $225 (10% below)
- If Tesla drops to $225, auto-sells
- Limits loss to 10%

---

### When to Use Stop-Losses

**✅ Good for:**

**1. Short-term trading**
- Day trading or swing trading
- Need automatic protection
- Can't watch market constantly

**2. Speculative positions**
- Risky individual stocks
- Small cap or penny stocks
- Positions you're not confident holding long-term

**3. Protecting short-term gains**
- Bought at $100, now $150
- Set stop at $135 (locks in at least $35 profit)
- Called a "trailing stop-loss"

---

### When NOT to Use Stop-Losses

**❌ Bad for:**

**1. Long-term investing**
- Buy-and-hold strategy
- Stop-loss defeats the purpose
- Market volatility will trigger it prematurely

**Example failure:**
- March 2020 COVID crash: Market dropped 35%
- Stop-losses triggered at $200
- Market recovered to $300 by end of year
- **Stop-loss sold at worst price, missed recovery**

**2. Index funds (VOO, VTI)**
- Long-term holds
- Expect volatility
- Don't want to be stopped out

**3. Dividend stocks for income**
- Hold for dividends, not price
- Short-term price fluctuations don't matter
- Stop-loss inappropriate

---

### Alternatives to Stop-Losses for Long-Term Investors

**Instead of stop-losses:**

**1. Proper position sizing**
- No more than 5-10% per position
- Can tolerate 50% drop without catastrophe

**2. Diversification**
- Own many positions
- One position dropping doesn't destroy portfolio

**3. Emergency fund**
- Never forced to sell
- Can hold through downturns

**4. Emotional discipline**
- Commit to holding through volatility
- Don't panic sell
- Trust the process

---

## Rule #8: The Sequence of Safety

### Build Your Financial Foundation

**Follow this sequence (don't skip steps):**

**Step 1: Emergency Fund**
- 3-6 months expenses in savings
- Non-negotiable foundation
- Must complete before investing

**Step 2: Pay Off High-Interest Debt**
- Credit cards (15-25% APY)
- Payday loans
- Any debt over 8% interest
- **Why:** Can't beat 20% credit card interest by investing in 10% stock market

**Step 3: Retirement Accounts (with Match)**
- 401(k) employer match is free money
- Contribute at least enough to get full match
- Example: If employer matches 5%, contribute 5%

**Step 4: Individual Brokerage Account**
- Now start regular investing
- Index funds for core
- Individual stocks for learning (small %)

**Step 5: Maximize Retirement Contributions**
- Max out 401(k): $23,000/year (2024)
- Max out IRA: $7,000/year (2024)
- Tax advantages + compound growth

**Step 6: Aggressive Wealth Building**
- Taxable brokerage account
- Real estate (optional)
- Alternative investments (optional)
