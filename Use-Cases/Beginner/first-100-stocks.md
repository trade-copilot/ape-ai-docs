```

### What Money Will Ask You

Money Monty will help you think through:

* **Time horizon:** How long until you need this money?
  * 1-3 years = Short-term
  * 3-5 years = Medium-term
  * 5+ years = Long-term
* **Risk tolerance:** How comfortable are you with ups and downs?

  * Companies you believe in

**💡 Tip:** Be honest about your risk tolerance. It's okay to be conservative as a beginner!

***

## Step 2: Get Stock Recommendations

### Money Monty's Typical Recommendations for $100

**For Conservative Beginners:** Money might suggest:

* Large-cap tech stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL)
* Dividend-paying blue chips (KO, JNJ, PG)
* Index ETFs (SPY, VOO, VTI)

**For $100 Split Strategy:** Money often recommends splitting your $100:

* $50 in a solid large-cap stock (e.g., Apple)
* $50 in a broad market ETF (e.g., SPY)

### Review the Analysis

For each recommendation, Money provides:

* **Why This Stock:** Company strengths and growth potential
* **Risks:** What could go wrong
* **Entry Price:** Suggested buy range
* **Time Horizon:** How long to hold

**Example Response:**

```
Here's a balanced $100 starter plan:

$50 → AAPL (Apple)
- Strong brand, consistent growth
- Current price: $175
- Buy 0.28 shares (fractional)
- Risk: Moderate, tech sector exposure

$50 → SPY (S&P 500 ETF)
- Instant diversification (500 companies)
- Current price: $470
- Buy 0.10 shares (fractional)
- Risk: Low, tracks overall market

Why this split:
- AAPL gives you exposure to a strong individual company
- SPY gives you broad market diversification
- Both good for 5+ year hold
```

## Step 4: Make Your Decision

### Decision Checklist

Before buying, answer these questions:

✅ **Do I understand what this company does?**

* If no → Do more research or ask Money to explain

✅ **Am I comfortable with the risks?**

* If no → Ask Money Monty for more conservative options

✅ **Can I hold this for 5+ years?**

* If no → Stocks might not be right for your timeframe

✅ **Am I okay if this drops 20-30% temporarily?**

* If no → Consider more conservative investments

✅ **Is this money I can afford to lose?**

* If no → Don't invest it in stocks

### Adjust Your Plan

If you're not comfortable with the recommendations:

**Ask Money Monty to adjust:**

```
This feels too risky for me. Can you suggest
more conservative options for my first $100?
```

Or:

```
I want more growth potential. Can you suggest
stocks with higher upside for my first $100?
```

## Step 5: Place Your First Trade

### Execute the Trade

Once you've decided, Money Monty will show **Trade Setup Cards**:

**For Stock Orders:**

* **Ticker:** e.g., AAPL
* **Side:** Buy
* **Type:** Market or Limit
* **Quantity:** Shares to buy (fractional okay)
* **Estimated Cost:** Total $ amount

### Choose Order Type

**Market Order (Recommended for Beginners)**

* Executes immediately at current price
* Guaranteed to fill
* Price might vary slightly

**Limit Order (More Control)**

* You set maximum price you'll pay
* Only executes if price reaches your limit
* Might not fill if stock doesn't hit your price

**💡 For your first $100:** Use Market orders. The small price difference won't matter much, and you'll learn faster by getting filled immediately.

### Review Before Submitting

**Check:**

* ✅ Correct ticker symbol
* ✅ Correct number of shares
* ✅ Buy (not sell!)
* ✅ Total cost fits your budget

### Submit the Order

1. Tap **"Execute trade"**
2. Review one final time
3. Confirm the order
4. Wait for fill confirmation (usually seconds for market orders)

**🎉 Congratulations!** You're now a stock owner!

## Step 6: Track Your Investment

### Monitor Your Portfolio

**Where to Find It:**

* Go to **Portfolio** tab
* See your new position under "Positions"
* View:
  * Current value
  * Gain/Loss $ and %
  * Entry price

### Set Check-In Reminders

**Don't obsess over daily changes!**

Recommended check-in frequency:

* **First week:** Daily (get comfortable with volatility)
* **First month:** Every few days
* **After that:** Weekly or monthly

**💡 Tip:** Price will go up and down. That's normal! Your time horizon is 5+ years, not 5 days.

### What to Watch

**Quarterly (Every 3 Months):**

* Company earnings reports
* Any major news about your stocks
* Overall portfolio performance

**Annually:**

* Review if stocks still match your goals
* Consider rebalancing if needed
* Assess if you want to add more

***

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This

**1. Panic selling when price drops**

* Stocks go up AND down
* Short-term volatility is normal
* Selling locks in losses

**2. Checking price every hour**

* Creates unnecessary stress
* Leads to emotional decisions
* Long-term investing requires patience

**3. Buying because "everyone's talking about it"**

* FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) is dangerous
* Hype doesn't equal good investment
* Stick to your research

**4. Investing money you need soon**

* Stocks are for long-term (5+ years)
* Don't invest rent money
* Keep emergency fund separate

**5. Trying to time the market**

* Nobody can predict short-term moves
* Time IN the market beats timing the market
* Focus on long-term holding

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't have enough money for whole shares"

**Solution:** Use fractional shares!

* Most brokers support fractional shares
* You can buy $50 of Apple even if shares cost $175
* You'll own 0.28 shares (perfectly fine!)

### "The trade didn't fill"

**For Limit Orders:**

* Price might not have reached your limit
* Change to market order, or
* Adjust your limit price

**For Market Orders:**

* Check your buying power
* Verify brokerage connection
* Contact support if issue persists

### "I'm scared after my first day"

**This is normal!**

* Stock prices fluctuate daily
* Down days happen to everyone
* Your time horizon is years, not days
* Consider not checking daily price

**Ask Money Monty:**

```
My stock dropped 5% on my first day. Should I be worried?
```

Money Monty will help put it in perspective!
