### Step 2: Check the AI Snapshot Grades

You'll land on the ticker page. First thing: **check the 4 grades**.

**The 4 Grades:**
1. **Fundamental** (A-F) - Company health, earnings, growth
2. **Technical** (A-F) - Chart patterns, momentum
3. **Sentiment** (A-F) - What analysts and social media say
4. **Risk** (A-F) - Downside risks, volatility

**Quick interpretation:**
- **A's and B's** ✅ - Generally positive
- **C's** ⚠️ - Neutral, be careful
- **D's and F's** ❌ - Warning signs

**Example:** TSLA might show:
- Fundamental: B- (good growth but pricey)
- Technical: A+ (strong momentum)
- Sentiment: A- (bullish overall)
- Risk: C- (high volatility)

---

### Step 3: Read "How It Makes Money"

Scroll down to the **Company Story** section. Tap/click the first card:

**"How It Makes Money"**

![How It Makes Money - TSLA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trade-copilot/ape-ai-docs/main/Screenshots/Web/tsla-how-it-makes-money.jpg)

This explains:
- Tesla's business model (EVs, energy, AI)
- Main revenue streams
- What products they sell

**Read this to understand:** What does this company actually do?

---

### Step 4: Check "Pricey or Cheap"

This is the key valuation question! Scroll to the **"Pricey or Cheap"** card and tap/click to expand.

![Pricey or Cheap - TSLA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trade-copilot/ape-ai-docs/main/Screenshots/Web/tsla-pricey-or-cheap.jpg)

**What you'll learn:**
- Is the stock overvalued or undervalued?
- How does it compare to competitors?
- What's a fair value estimate?

**But we can go deeper with AI...**

---

### Step 5: Ask the AI "Is It Overvalued?"

Let's get AI analysis on the valuation.

**📱 iOS:**
1. Scroll down on the ticker page
2. Tap **"Pricey or Cheap"** quick prompt (if available)

   OR

1. Go to **Chat tab** (bottom)
2. Use Quick Action: **"Pricey or Cheap"**
3. Select TSLA when prompted

**🌐 Web:**
1. Click **Chat** in sidebar
2. Click **Prompts icon** (or press `Ctrl+P`)
3. Select **"Pricey or Cheap"**
4. Type "TSLA" when asked

**The AI will tell you:**
- Current valuation metrics
- Compared to historical average
- Compared to peers (other EV companies)
- Whether it's expensive or cheap right now
- Key risks to the valuation

**This is the answer to:** *"Should I buy it at this price?"*

---

### Step 6: Read Bulls vs Bears

Go back to the ticker page (if you're in Chat) and scroll to **Bulls vs Bears** section.

![Bulls vs Bears - TSLA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trade-copilot/ape-ai-docs/main/Screenshots/Web/tsla-bulls-bears.jpg)

**You'll see:**
- **Analyst breakdown**: % Buy, Hold, Sell
- **Visual bar**: Green (bullish) vs Red (bearish)
- **Bulls Say**: Why people are optimistic
- **Bears Say**: Why people are cautious

**Read both sides!** This prevents confirmation bias.

---

### Step 7: Check the Risks ("Bagholder Risks")

Scroll to Company Story and tap **"Bagholder Risks"**

![Bagholder Risks - TSLA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trade-copilot/ape-ai-docs/main/Screenshots/Web/tsla-bagholder-risks.jpg)

**This tells you:**
- What could go wrong long-term
- Risks for holding the stock
- Warning signs to watch

**Example TSLA risks:**
- Competition from legacy automakers
- Dependence on Elon Musk
- Regulatory changes
- Valuation risk (if earnings disappoint)

**Don't skip this!** Every stock has risks.

---

### Step 8: Compare Performance vs S&P 500

Scroll down to **Performance Comparison**

![Performance vs SPY](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trade-copilot/ape-ai-docs/main/Screenshots/Web/tsla-performance.jpg)

**You'll see:**
- TSLA's return vs S&P 500 over time
- Outperformance or underperformance %
- Chart showing both performances

**Why this matters:**
- If it's underperforming the market, why buy it?
- If it's outperforming, is it sustainable?

---

## Decision Framework

After your research, you should know:

✅ **What the company does** (How It Makes Money)
✅ **If it's overvalued or not** (Pricey or Cheap + AI analysis)
✅ **What bulls and bears think** (Sentiment)
✅ **What could go wrong** (Bagholder Risks)
✅ **How it's performed** (vs S&P 500)

**Now ask yourself:**
1. Do I understand the business?
2. Do I believe in the long-term story?
3. Am I comfortable with the valuation?
4. Can I handle the risks?
5. Is this better than just buying SPY (S&P 500)?

**If YES to all 5** → Consider adding to watchlist or buying
**If NO to any** → Keep researching or pass
