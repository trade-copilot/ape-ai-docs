1. Go to **Chat**
2. Ask AI: *"What are good beginner-friendly stocks to learn with?"*
3. AI will suggest stable, well-known companies (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL)

<!-- TODO: Screenshot missing: ai-learning-stocks.png -->

**Or pick one you know:**

4. Read **Company Story** sections
5. Get comfortable with the company

**Don't rush!** Take your time learning.

---

### Place Your First Trade

**In your brokerage app/platform with paper account:**

> **Note:** Trade execution happens in your brokerage's paper trading platform, not directly in Ape AI (yet). Ape AI helps you research and find setups.

1. Open your broker's paper trading platform
2. Search for the stock (AAPL)
3. Click **"Buy"** or **"Trade"**
4. Enter details:
   - **Quantity:** Start small (1-5 shares)
   - **Order Type:** Market order (simplest)
   - **Account:** Select paper trading account
5. **Review** the order
6. **Submit**

<!-- TODO: Screenshot missing: paper-trade-execution.png -->

**Congrats! You just placed your first trade!** 🎉

---

### Track It in Ape AI

**📱 iOS / 🌐 Web:**
1. Go to **Portfolio tab/page**
2. Your paper trading position should sync
3. Monitor daily P/L (profit/loss)
4. Watch how the stock moves

<!-- TODO: Screenshot missing: portfolio-paper-position.png -->

---

## Step 6: Learn Options Trading (Risk-Free)

Now let's try options—the fun part!

### Understand Options Basics (Quick Primer)

**Call Option:**
- You're betting the stock goes UP
- You profit if it rises above strike price
- Limited risk (you can only lose what you paid)

**Put Option:**
- You're betting the stock goes DOWN
- You profit if it falls below strike price
- Limited risk (you can only lose what you paid)

**Key terms:**
- **Strike Price:** The price level of your bet
- **Expiration:** When the option expires (weekly, monthly)
- **Premium:** What you pay for the option

---

### Get AI Options Recommendations

Let's ask AI for a learning-friendly options setup:

**📱 iOS / 🌐 Web:**
1. Go to **Chat**
2. Ask: *"What's a simple options trade for a beginner to learn with? I have a paper trading account."*

<!-- TODO: Screenshot missing: ai-options-beginner.png -->

**AI might suggest:**
- Buy a call on AAPL (bullish bet)
- Strike price slightly above current price
- Expiration 1-2 weeks out
- Reasoning: Simple, liquid, easy to understand

---

### Place Your First Options Trade

**In your paper trading brokerage:**

1. Search for the stock (AAPL)
2. Click **"Trade Options"** or **"Options Chain"**
3. Choose **Calls** (betting on upside)
4. Select:
   - **Expiration:** 1-2 weeks out (not too far)
   - **Strike:** Just above current price (e.g., if AAPL is $180, choose $185)
5. **Buy** 1 contract (start with 1!)
6. **Review** and **Submit**

<!-- TODO: Screenshot missing: options-chain-paper.png -->

**You now own an options contract!**

---

### Ask AI to Explain What Happens

Go back to Ape AI Chat:

**Ask questions like:**
- *"I bought a $185 call on AAPL expiring next Friday. Explain how this makes money."*
- *"What happens if AAPL goes to $190?"*
- *"What happens if it drops to $170?"*
- *"When should I sell this option?"*

<!-- TODO: Screenshot missing: ai-explain-option.png -->

**The AI will teach you** how your trade works and what to expect.

---

## Step 7: Monitor and Learn

### Watch Your Positions

**📱 iOS / 🌐 Web:**
1. Go to **Portfolio**
2. Check the **Options tab**
3. See your position P/L update in real-time

<!-- TODO: Screenshot missing: options-position-tracking.png -->

**Watch how it changes:**
- Stock goes up → Call value increases
- Stock goes down → Call value decreases
- Time passes → Option loses value (theta decay)

**This is how you learn!**

---

### Ask Maverick Questions

Use the **Ask Maverick** feature in Portfolio:

**Questions to ask:**
- *"How is my AAPL call doing?"*
- *"Should I take profits or hold?"*
- *"What did I learn from this trade?"*
- *"What should I do differently next time?"*

<!-- TODO: Screenshot missing: ask-maverick-questions.png -->

Maverick will analyze your paper trades and give feedback!

---

## Step 8: Practice Different Strategies

Once comfortable with basic calls, try:

### 1. Buy a Put (Bearish Bet)
- Pick a stock you think will drop
- Buy a put option
- Watch what happens

### 2. Try Different Strikes
- In-the-money (safer, more expensive)
- At-the-money (balanced)
- Out-of-the-money (riskier, cheaper)

### 3. Try Different Expirations
- Weekly (fast-moving, risky)
- Monthly (more time, higher cost)

### 4. Learn to Take Profits
- Don't always hold to expiration
- Sell when up 50%+ to lock gains
- Learn when to cut losses

**All risk-free with paper trading!**

---

## Step 9: Journal Your Trades

Keep track of what you learn:

**For each trade, note:**
- Date and time
- What you bought (stock/option details)
- Why you bought it
- What happened
- What you learned

**Example:**
```
Trade #1: AAPL $185 Call (exp 11/15)
Why: Thought AAPL would go up on earnings
Result: +$120 profit (sold after 2 days)
Learned: Options move faster than stocks!
         Sell when you hit your target
         Don't get greedy
```
