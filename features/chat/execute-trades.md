## 📱 How to Execute a Trade

### Step 1: Get AI Trade Recommendation

Ask AI for a trade setup:

**Examples:**
- "Find me a day trade options setup for TSLA"
- "What's a good swing trade entry for NVDA?"
- "Show me high-probability call options expiring this week"

AI responds with a recommendation:

> **AI (Blitz):** "TSLA day trade setup:
>
> **Stock:** TSLA
> **Setup:** Momentum breakout
> **Entry:** $470 calls expiring Friday
> **Premium:** ~$5.50
> **Target:** $8.00 (45% gain)
> **Stop:** $4.50 (18% loss)
> **Risk/Reward:** 3:1
>
> Reasoning: TSLA breaking resistance at $470 with volume. Strong intraday momentum. Target $478 by EOD."

## ⚙️ Order Types Explained

### Market Order
- **Executes immediately** at current market price
- **Fast** but price not guaranteed
- **Best for:** Liquid stocks, urgent entries

### Limit Order
- **Executes at your price or better**
- May not fill if price doesn't reach your limit
- **Best for:** Precise entries, illiquid options

### Stop Loss (After Entry)
- AI recommendations include stop loss levels
- You can set stop loss after trade is filled
- Do this in your brokerage's interface or Portfolio tab

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Always Review Before Confirming
AI is smart but not perfect:
- Check the strike and expiration
- Verify quantity fits your risk
- Confirm you have buying power
- Make sure it's the right ticker!

**You have final control.** Don't blindly execute.

---

### 2. Adjust Quantity for Your Risk Tolerance

**AI might suggest:** "Buy 5 contracts"

**Your decision:**
- New trader? Start with 1
- Experienced? Maybe 5 is fine
- Small account? Buy fewer
- Large account? Scale up

**Never risk more than you're comfortable losing.**

---

### 3. Use Limit Orders for Options

Options spreads can be wide:
- Market order might get bad fill
- Limit order ensures your price
- Wait for your price to get hit

**Exception:** Very liquid options (SPY, QQQ, AAPL) might be okay with market orders.

---

### 4. Set Stop Losses Immediately

After trade fills:
1. Go to Portfolio tab
2. Find your position
3. Set stop loss at AI's recommended level
4. Protect your downside

**Don't forget this step!** Stop losses save accounts.

---

### 5. Paper Trade First

**Not sure about executing from chat?**
- Connect Ape Paper Trading Account
- Practice with fake money
- Get comfortable with the flow
- Then graduate to real money

## 🎯 Real Example Workflow

### Scenario: Day Trading TSLA Calls

**9:15 AM - Ask AI:**
> "Find me a day trade options setup for TSLA"

**AI Response (Blitz):**
> "TSLA $470 calls exp today. Entry $5.50, target $8.00. Strong momentum."

**9:16 AM - Execute:**
1. Tap **"Execute Trade"**
2. Review: 1 contract, limit $5.50
3. Confirm with Face ID
4. Order placed ✅

**11:30 AM - Check Position:**
- TSLA calls now at $7.20
- Up 31% 🚀
- AI: "Consider taking profits at $8.00 target"

**11:45 AM - Exit:**
1. Ask AI: "Should I close my TSLA call?"
2. AI: "TSLA hitting resistance. Take profits now."
3. Tap **"Execute Trade"** (Sell to Close)
4. Sold at $7.80 ✅

**Result:**
- Entry: $5.50

## 🚧 Troubleshooting

### "Execute Trade" Button Not Showing

**Possible reasons:**
1. No brokerage connected → [Connect one](../Brokerage/connecting.md)
2. Trading permissions disabled → Enable in Settings
3. AI response wasn't a specific trade setup → Ask for specific entry
4. Your brokerage doesn't support this feature → Check supported list

---

### Order Rejected

**Common causes:**
1. Insufficient buying power
2. Options trading not approved (upgrade brokerage account)
3. Market closed (can only place orders during market hours)
4. Incorrect order details (review and fix)

---

### Order Filled at Different Price

**Why:**
- Market orders fill at current market price (can vary)
- Limit orders fill at your price or better
- Fast-moving stocks can have slippage

**Solution:** Use limit orders for more control.
