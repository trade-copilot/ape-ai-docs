## 🎯 What are Themes?

**Themes** are custom stock lists created using natural language. Instead of complex screening criteria, just describe what you want.

**Think of them as:**
- Smart stock lists
- Natural language screener
- Custom watchlists on steroids
- AI-powered stock collections

**Instead of:** "Filter by P/E < 15 AND Revenue Growth > 20% AND Market Cap > $10B"

**Just say:** "Find me undervalued tech stocks with strong growth"

**AI understands and creates the list.**

---

## 💡 How Themes Work

### Traditional Stock Screener:
```
1. Choose filters (P/E, Market Cap, Sector...)
2. Set values (P/E < 15, Market Cap > $10B...)
3. Apply filters
4. Get results
5. Save as watchlist
```
**Time:** 10-15 minutes. **Hard to use.**

---

### Ape AI Themes:
```
1. Describe what you want in plain English
2. AI creates the theme
3. Get results instantly
```
**Time:** 30 seconds. **Easy.**

**That's the power of natural language.**
