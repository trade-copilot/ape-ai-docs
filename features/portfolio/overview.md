## 🎯 Key Metrics Explained

### Total Portfolio Value
**What it is:** Current market value of all your holdings + cash

**Formula:**
```
(Shares × Current Price) for each stock + Cash Balance
```

**Example:**
- 10 TSLA @ $465 = $4,650
- 50 AAPL @ $180 = $9,000
- Cash = $5,000
- **Total = $18,650**

---

### Cost Basis
**What it is:** How much you paid for each stock (avg if multiple buys)

**Why it matters:** Determines your profit/loss and tax liability

**Example:**
- Bought 5 TSLA @ $440 = $2,200
- Bought 5 more @ $460 = $2,300
- Cost Basis = $4,500 / 10 shares = **$450/share**

---

### Unrealized P&L
**What it is:** Paper gains/losses on open positions

**Formula:**
```
(Current Price - Cost Basis) × Shares
```

**Example:**
- 10 TSLA @ $465 current
- Cost basis $450
- Unrealized P&L = ($465 - $450) × 10 = **+$150**

**Not real money until you sell!**

---

### Realized P&L
**What it is:** Actual profits/losses from closed trades

**Shows in:** Order history, tax reports

**Example:**
- Bought 10 AAPL @ $170 = $1,700
- Sold 10 AAPL @ $180 = $1,800
- Realized P&L = **+$100**

**This IS real money (and taxable).**

---

### Day Change
**What it is:** How much your portfolio moved today

**Resets daily at 4:00 PM ET close**

**Example:**
- Yesterday close: $45,000
- Today now: $47,105
- Day Change: **+$2,105 (+4.68%)**

---

### Return %
**What it is:** Total return since you started

**Formula:**
```
(Current Value - Total Invested) / Total Invested × 100
```

**Example:**
- Invested $37,000 total
- Current value $45,250
- Return = ($45,250 - $37,000) / $37,000 = **+22.3%**

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Check Portfolio Daily (But Don't Obsess)
**Morning routine:**
- Check overall P&L
- See biggest movers
- Read AI alerts
- Plan day's trades

**Don't check every 5 minutes. That's stressful.**

---

### 2. Use Snapshot Grades
**Quick portfolio health check:**
- Sort by grade (worst first)
- See which holdings are struggling
- Consider trimming positions with D or F grades
- Double down on A grades

---

### 3. Monitor Allocation
**Don't be too concentrated:**
- Keep any single stock under 20% of portfolio
- Diversify across sectors
- AI will alert if you're too concentrated

---

### 4. Set Target Exits
**For each position, know:**
- Profit target (where to sell for gains)
- Stop loss (where to bail if wrong)
- Time frame (how long to hold)

**Portfolio helps you track this.**

---

### 5. Review Weekly, Not Daily
**Weekly review (Sunday evening):**
- What worked this week?
- What didn't?
- Any positions to trim?
- What to add next week?

**Deep review monthly.**
