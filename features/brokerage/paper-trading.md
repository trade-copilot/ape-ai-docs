## 📊 Track Your Progress

### Keep a Trading Journal

For each paper trade, note:
- **Date:** When you entered
- **Ticker:** What you bought
- **Why:** Reasoning for the trade
- **Result:** What happened
- **Lesson:** What you learned

**Example:**
```
Trade #5: TSLA $470 Call (11/15 exp)
Date: 11/8/24
Why: Thought it would gap up after delivery numbers
Result: -$85 loss (IV crushed after news)
Lesson: Don't buy options right before known events.
        IV is inflated and crashes after news.
        Next time: Sell options before events!
```

## 💡 Pro Tips for Paper Trading

### 1. Treat It Like Real Money
Don't take crazy risks just because it's fake.
- Trade with realistic position sizes
- Use stop losses
- Follow your trading plan
- Practice discipline

**Bad:** "I'll YOLO $100k on 0DTE options lol"
**Good:** "I'll risk 2% per trade like I would with real money"

---

### 2. Practice for Weeks/Months
Don't rush to real money!
- Paper trade for at least 1-3 months
- Be consistently profitable
- Understand why your wins won and losses lost
- Build emotional discipline

**When to go real:** After 2-3 months of consistent profitability.

---

### 3. Focus on Process, Not Just Results
- Did you follow your plan? ✅
- Did you manage risk properly? ✅
- Did you learn something? ✅

**Good traders have a process.** Paper trading is where you build yours.

---

### 4. Start Small
- 1-5 shares of stock
- 1 options contract
- Simple strategies first
- Add complexity gradually

---

### 5. Ask AI Everything
Use Ape AI to learn:
- *"Explain why my call option lost value"*
- *"What's a good entry point for beginners?"*
- *"How do I know when to sell?"*
- *"What's theta decay?"*

**No stupid questions in paper trading!**

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

### Paper Trading is NOT Exactly Like Real Trading

**What's different:**
1. **No emotions** - You won't feel real fear/greed
2. **Perfect fills** - Real trading has slippage
3. **No commissions** - (though most brokers are $0 now)
4. **Risk-free** - Changes your psychology

**That's OK!** It's still the best way to learn mechanics and strategy.

---

### When You're Ready for Real Money

**You're ready when:**
- ✅ You understand how stocks and options work
- ✅ You have a trading strategy (not guessing)
- ✅ You've been profitable for 2-3 months
