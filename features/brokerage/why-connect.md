## 🎯 What Does "Connect Brokerage" Mean?

**Think of it like:**
- Linking your bank to Mint or Credit Karma
- Connecting Spotify to your car
- Syncing your calendar to your email

**It's a secure connection** that lets Ape AI see your portfolio and (optionally) execute trades.

**No passwords stored. OAuth 2.0 secure authentication.**
